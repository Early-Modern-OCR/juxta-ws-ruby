<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm<lb/>
of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long<lb/>
Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random<lb/>
allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,<lb/>
sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the<lb/>
higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts,<lb/>
for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient<lb/>
authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts<lb/>
are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird&#x0027;s<lb/>
eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung<lb/>
of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.</p>
<p>So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I<lb/>
am. Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of<lb/>
this world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be<lb/>
too rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel<lb/>
poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them<lb/>
bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether<lb/>
unpleasant sadness&#x2014;Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more<lb/>
pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for<lb/>
ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and<lb/>
the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the<lb/>
royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before<lb/>
are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of<lb/>
long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming.<lb/>

<head>CHAPTER I.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">loomings</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Call</hi> me Ishmael. Some years ago&#x2014;never mind how long<lb/>
precisely&#x2014;having little or no money in my purse, and nothing<lb/>
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about<lb/>
a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have<lb/>
of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. When-<lb/>
ever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it<lb/>
is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself<lb/>
involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up<lb/>
the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my<lb/>
hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong<lb/>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into<lb/>
the street, and methodically knocking people&#x0027;s hats off&#x2014;then, I<lb/>
account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my<lb/>
substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish<lb/>
Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the<lb/>
ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it,<lb/>
almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very<lb/>
nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.</p>
<p>There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted<lb/>
round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs&#x2014;commerce sur-<lb/>
rounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you<lb/>
waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that<lb/>
noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which<lb/>
a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the<lb/>
crowds of water-gazers there.</p>
<p>Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.<lb/>
Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n39" n="2"/>
Whitehall, northward. What do you see?&#x2014;Posted like silent<lb/>
sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands<lb/>
of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the<lb/>
spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the<lb/>
bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging,<lb/>
as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are<lb/>
all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster&#x2014;tied<lb/>
to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then<lb/>
is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?</p>
<p>But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight<lb/>
for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing<lb/>
will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering<lb/>
under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No.<lb/>
They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can<lb/>
without falling in. And there they stand&#x2014;miles of them&#x2014;<lb/>
leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets<lb/>
and avenues&#x2014;north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all<lb/>
unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the<lb/>
compasses of all those ships attract them thither?</p>
<p>Once more. Say, you are in the country; in some high<lb/>
land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one<lb/>
it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in<lb/>
the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded<lb/>
of men be plunged in his deepest reveries&#x2014;stand that man on<lb/>
his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to<lb/>
water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be<lb/>
athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your<lb/>
caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor.<lb/>
Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for<lb/>
ever.</p>
<p>But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dream-<lb/>
iest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic land-<lb/>
scape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element<lb/>
he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n40" n="3"/>
as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his<lb/>
meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage<lb/>
goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a<lb/>
mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed<lb/>
in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus<lb/>
tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like<lb/>
leaves upon this shepherd&#x0027;s head, yet all were vain, unless the<lb/>
shepherd&#x0027;s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.<lb/>
Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of<lb/>
miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies&#x2014;what is the<lb/>
one charm wanting?&#x2014;Water&#x2014;there is not a drop of water<lb/>
there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you<lb/>
travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet<lb/>
of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver,<lb/>
deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly<lb/>
needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway<lb/>
Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a<lb/>
robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go<lb/>
to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you<lb/>
yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you<lb/>
and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the,<lb/>
old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it<lb/>
a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is<lb/>
not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that<lb/>
story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the torment-<lb/>
ing, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and<lb/>
was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers<lb/>
and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of<lb/>
life; and this is the key to it all.</p>
<p>Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea<lb/>
whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be<lb/>
over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred<lb/>
that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger<lb/>
you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n41" n="4"/>
you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick&#x2014;<lb/>
grow quarrelsome&#x2014;don&#x0027;t sleep of nights&#x2014;do not enjoy them-<lb/>
selves much, as a general thing;&#x2014;no, I never go as a passen-<lb/>
ger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever<lb/>
go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I aban-<lb/>
don the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like<lb/>
them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable<lb/>
toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is<lb/>
quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without<lb/>
taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.<lb/>
And as for going as cook,&#x2014;though I confess there is considerable<lb/>
glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board&#x2014;<lb/>
yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;&#x2014;though once<lb/>
broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and<lb/>
peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not<lb/>
to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of<lb/>
the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis<lb/>
and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those<lb/>
creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.</p>
<p>No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before<lb/>
the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there<lb/>
to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and<lb/>
make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a<lb/>
May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant<lb/>
enough. It touches one&#x0027;s sense of honor, particularly if you<lb/>
come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensse-<lb/>
laers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all,<lb/>
if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have<lb/>
been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest<lb/>
boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I<lb/>
assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong<lb/>
decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and<lb/>
bear it. But even this wears off in time.</p>
<p>What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n42" n="5"/>
get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that<lb/>
indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New<lb/>
Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks any-<lb/>
thing the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey<lb/>
that old hunks in that particular instance? Who aint a slave?<lb/>
Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may<lb/>
order me about&#x2014;however they may thump and punch me<lb/>
about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;<lb/>
that everybody else is one way or other served in much the<lb/>
same way&#x2014;either in a physical or metaphysical point of view,<lb/>
that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all<lb/>
hands should rub each other&#x0027;s shoulder-blades, and be con-<lb/>
tent.</p>
<p>Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make<lb/>
a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay<lb/>
passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the con-<lb/>
trary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the<lb/>
difference in the world between paying and being paid. The<lb/>
act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that<lb/>
the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But <hi rend="i">being paid</hi>,<lb/>
&#x2014;what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a<lb/>
man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so<lb/>
earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and<lb/>
that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how<lb/>
cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!</p>
<p>Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the whole-<lb/>
some exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. For as<lb/>
in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from<lb/>
astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so<lb/>
for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his<lb/>
atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle.<lb/>
He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same<lb/>
way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other<lb/>
things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n43" n="6"/>
wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a<lb/>
merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a<lb/>
whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who<lb/>
has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and<lb/>
influences me in some unaccountable way&#x2014;he can better answer<lb/>
than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling<lb/>
voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that<lb/>
was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief<lb/>
interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take<lb/>
it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="i">Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.</hi><lb/>
&#x201C;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.<lb/>
&#x201C;BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage<lb/>
managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a<lb/>
whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent<lb/>
parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel<lb/>
comedies, and jolly parts in farces&#x2014;though I cannot tell why<lb/>
this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I<lb/>
think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being<lb/>
cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me<lb/>
to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into<lb/>
the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased<lb/>
freewill and discriminating judgment.</p>
<p>Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the<lb/>
great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster<lb/>
roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where<lb/>
he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of<lb/>
the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand<lb/>
Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.<lb/>
With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been<lb/>
inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlas-<lb/>
ting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n44" n="7"/>
land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am<lb/>
quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it<lb/>
&#x2014;would they let me&#x2014;since it is but well to be on friendly<lb/>
terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.</p>
<p>By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was wel-<lb/>
come; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open,<lb/>
and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two<lb/>
and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions<lb/>
of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phan-<lb/>
tom, like a snow hill in the air.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the carpet-bag</hi>.</head>
<p>I <hi rend="sc">stuffed</hi> a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it<lb/>
under my arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.<lb/>
Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New<lb/>
Bedford. It was on a Saturday night in December. Much<lb/>
was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for<lb/>
Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that<lb/>
place would offer, till the following Monday.</p>
<p>As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of<lb/>
whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on<lb/>
their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no<lb/>
idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no<lb/>
other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous<lb/>
something about everything connected with that famous old<lb/>
island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New<lb/>
Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the business<lb/>
of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is<lb/>
now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original&#x2014;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n45" n="8"/>
the Tyre of this Carthage;&#x2014;the place where the first dead<lb/>
American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket<lb/>
did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-men, first sally out in<lb/>
canoes to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from<lb/>
Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth,<lb/>
partly laden with imported cobble-stones&#x2014;so goes the story&#x2014;<lb/>
to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were<lb/>
nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?</p>
<p>Now having a night, a day, and still another night following<lb/>
before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined<lb/>
port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat<lb/>
and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a<lb/>
very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew<lb/>
no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded<lb/>
my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,&#x2014;So,<lb/>
wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the<lb/>
middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing<lb/>
the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the<lb/>
south&#x2014;wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge<lb/>
for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price,<lb/>
and don&#x0027;t be too particular.</p>
<p>With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of<lb/>
&#x201C;The Crossed Harpoons&#x201D;&#x2014;but it looked too expensive and<lb/>
jolly there. Further on, from the bright red windows of the<lb/>
&#x201C;Sword-Fish Inn,&#x201D; there came such fervent rays, that it seemed<lb/>
to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house,<lb/>
for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a<lb/>
hard, asphaltic pavement,&#x2014;rather weary for me, when I struck<lb/>
my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard,<lb/>
remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most<lb/>
miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I,<lb/>
pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and<lb/>
hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within. But go on,<lb/>
Ishmael, said I at last; don&#x0027;t you hear? get away from before<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n46" n="9"/>
the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I<lb/>
went. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me<lb/>
waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the<lb/>
cheeriest inns.</p>
<p>Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on<lb/>
either hand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving<lb/>
about in a tomb. At this hour of the night, of the last day<lb/>
of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but deserted.<lb/>
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low,<lb/>
wide building, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had<lb/>
a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the public;<lb/>
so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash-<lb/>
box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles<lb/>
almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,<lb/>
Gomorrah? But &#x201C;The Crossed Harpoons,&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Sword-<lb/>
Fish?&#x201D;&#x2014;this, then, must needs be the sign of &#x201C;The Trap.&#x201D;<lb/>
However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within,<lb/>
pushed on and opened a second, interior door.</p>
<p>It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A<lb/>
hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer; and<lb/>
beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a<lb/>
pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher&#x0027;s text was<lb/>
about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing<lb/>
and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing<lb/>
out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of &#x201C;The Trap!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from<lb/>
the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking<lb/>
up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting<lb/>
upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray,<lb/>
and these words underneath&#x2014;&#x201C;The Spouter-Inn:&#x2014;Peter Coffin.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Coffin?&#x2014;Spouter?&#x2014;Rather ominous in that particular con-<lb/>
nexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket,<lb/>
they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.<lb/>
As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n47" n="10"/>
quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked<lb/>
as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt<lb/>
district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of<lb/>
creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap<lb/>
lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.</p>
<p>It was a queer sort of place&#x2014;a gable-ended old house, one<lb/>
side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a<lb/>
sharp bleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon<lb/>
kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor Paul&#x0027;s<lb/>
tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant<lb/>
zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly<lb/>
toasting for bed. &#x201C;In judging of that tempestuous wind called<lb/>
Euroclydon,&#x201D; says an old writer&#x2014;of whose works I possess the<lb/>
only copy extant&#x2014;&#x201C;It maketh a marvellous difference, whether<lb/>
thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all<lb/>
on the outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless<lb/>
window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which the<lb/>
wight Death is the only glazier.&#x201D; True enough, thought I, as<lb/>
this passage occurred to my mind&#x2014;old black-letter, thou reason-<lb/>
est well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine<lb/>
is the house. What a pity they didn&#x0027;t stop up the chinks and<lb/>
the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there.<lb/>
But it&#x0027;s too late to make any improvements now. The universe<lb/>
is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off<lb/>
a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth<lb/>
against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters<lb/>
with his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and<lb/>
put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out<lb/>
the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in<lb/>
his red silken wrapper&#x2014;(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh,<lb/>
pooh! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what<lb/>
northern lights! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes<lb/>
of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of making<lb/>
my own summer with my own coals.</p>
<pb xml:id="n48" n="11"/>
<p>But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by<lb/>
holding them up to the grand northern lights? Would not<lb/>
Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would he not far<lb/>
rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator;<lb/>
yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep<lb/>
out this frost?</p>
<p>Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone<lb/>
before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an<lb/>
iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives<lb/>
himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen<lb/>
sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only<lb/>
drinks the tepid tears of orphans.</p>
<p>But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling,<lb/>
and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice<lb/>
from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this &#x201C;Spouter&#x201D;<lb/>
may be.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the spouter-inn</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Entering</hi> that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself<lb/>
in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots,<lb/>
reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.<lb/>
On one side hung a very large oil-painting so thoroughly be-<lb/>
smoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal cross-lights<lb/>
by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a<lb/>
series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of the neigh-<lb/>
bors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its<lb/>
purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows,<lb/>
that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist,<lb/>
in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to deli-<lb/>
neate chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and earnest<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n49" n="12"/>
contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by<lb/>
throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry,<lb/>
you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however<lb/>
wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.</p>
<p>But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long,<lb/>
limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the<lb/>
centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines<lb/>
floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture<lb/>
truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was<lb/>
there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity<lb/>
about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily took an<lb/>
oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting<lb/>
meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would<lb/>
dart you through.&#x2014;It&#x0027;s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.&#x2014;It&#x0027;s<lb/>
the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.&#x2014;It&#x0027;s a<lb/>
blasted heath.&#x2014;It&#x0027;s a Hyperborean winter scene.&#x2014;It&#x0027;s the<lb/>
breaking-up of the ice-bound stream of Time. But at last all<lb/>
these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the<lb/>
picture&#x0027;s midst. <hi rend="i">That</hi> once found out, and all the rest were<lb/>
plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a<lb/>
gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?</p>
<p>In fact, the artist&#x0027;s design seemed this: a final theory of my<lb/>
own, partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged<lb/>
persons with whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture<lb/>
represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foun-<lb/>
dered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts<lb/>
alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring<lb/>
clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself<lb/>
upon the three mast-heads.</p>
<p>The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a<lb/>
heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were<lb/>
thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others<lb/>
were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped,<lb/>
with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n50" n="13"/>
the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered<lb/>
as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and<lb/>
savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a<lb/>
hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty<lb/>
old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.<lb/>
Some were storied weapons. With this once long lance, now<lb/>
wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen<lb/>
whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon&#x2014;so<lb/>
like a corkscrew now&#x2014;was flung in Javan seas, and run away<lb/>
with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco.<lb/>
The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle<lb/>
sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and<lb/>
at last was found imbedded in the hump.</p>
<p>Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched<lb/>
way&#x2014;cut through what in old times must have been a great<lb/>
central chimney with fire-places all round&#x2014;you enter the public<lb/>
room. A still duskier place is this, with such low ponderous<lb/>
beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you<lb/>
would almost fancy you trod some old craft&#x0027;s cockpits, espe-<lb/>
cially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored old<lb/>
ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-<lb/>
like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty<lb/>
rarities gathered from this wide world&#x0027;s remotest nooks. Pro-<lb/>
jecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-<lb/>
looking den&#x2014;the bar&#x2014;a rude attempt at a right whale&#x0027;s head.<lb/>
Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone of the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it.<lb/>
Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,<lb/>
bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like ano-<lb/>
ther cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),<lb/>
bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly<lb/>
sells the sailors deliriums and death.</p>
<p>Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.<lb/>
Though true cylinders without&#x2014;within, the villanous green<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n51" n="14"/>
goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating<lb/>
bottom. Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass, sur-<lb/>
round these footpads&#x0027; goblets. Fill to <hi rend="i">this</hi> mark, and your<lb/>
charge is but a penny; to <hi rend="i">this</hi> a penny more; and so on to the<lb/>
full glass&#x2014;the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulph down<lb/>
for a shilling.</p>
<p>Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen<lb/>
gathered about a table, examining by a dim light divers speci-<lb/>
mens of <hi rend="i">skrimshander.</hi> I sought the landlord, and telling him<lb/>
I desired to be accommodated with a room, received for answer<lb/>
that his house was full&#x2014;not a bed unoccupied. &#x201C;But avast,&#x201D;<lb/>
he added, tapping his forehead, &#x201C;you haint no objections to<lb/>
sharing a harpooneer&#x0027;s blanket, have ye? I s&#x0027;pose you are goin&#x0027;<lb/>
a whalin&#x0027;, so you&#x0027;d better get used to that sort of thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I<lb/>
should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer<lb/>
might be, and that if he (the landlord) really had no other<lb/>
place for me, and the harpooneer was not decidedly objection-<lb/>
able, why rather than wander further about a strange town on so<lb/>
bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent man&#x0027;s<lb/>
blanket.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?&#x2014;you<lb/>
want supper? Supper &#x0027;ll be ready directly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like<lb/>
a bench on the Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still<lb/>
further adorning it with his jack-knife, stooping over and dili-<lb/>
gently working away at the space between his legs. He was<lb/>
trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn&#x0027;t make<lb/>
much headway, I thought.</p>
<p>At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal<lb/>
in an adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland&#x2014;no fire at all<lb/>
&#x2014;the landlord said he couldn&#x0027;t afford it. Nothing but two dismal<lb/>
tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain to but-<lb/>
ton up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n52" n="15"/>
tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most<lb/>
substantial kind&#x2014;not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings;<lb/>
good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a<lb/>
green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most<lb/>
direful manner.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My boy,&#x201D; said the landlord, &#x201C;you&#x0027;ll have the nightmare<lb/>
to a dead sartainty.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord,&#x201D; I whispered, &#x201C;that aint the harpooneer, is it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, no,&#x201D; said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, &#x201C;the<lb/>
harpooner is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dump-<lb/>
lings, he don&#x0027;t&#x2014;he eats nothing but steaks, and likes &#x0027;em<lb/>
rare.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The devil he does,&#x201D; says I. &#x201C;Where is that harpooneer? Is<lb/>
he here?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;ll be here afore long,&#x201D; was the answer.</p>
<p>I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this<lb/>
&#x201C;dark complexioned&#x201D; harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my<lb/>
mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together, he<lb/>
must undress and get into bed before I did.</p>
<p>Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when,<lb/>
knowing not what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the<lb/>
rest of the evening as a looker on.</p>
<p>Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up,<lb/>
the landlord cried, &#x201C;That&#x0027;s the Grampus&#x0027;s crew. I seed her<lb/>
reported in the offing this morning; a three years&#x0027; voyage, and<lb/>
a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we&#x0027;ll have the latest news from<lb/>
the Feegees.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door<lb/>
was flung open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.<lb/>
Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats, and with their heads<lb/>
muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and<lb/>
their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears<lb/>
from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat, and this<lb/>
was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n53" n="16"/>
made a straight wake for the whale&#x0027;s mouth&#x2014;the bar&#x2014;when<lb/>
the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured<lb/>
them out brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold<lb/>
in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of<lb/>
gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for<lb/>
all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long stan-<lb/>
ding, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the wea-<lb/>
ther side of an ice-island.</p>
<p>The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does<lb/>
even with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they<lb/>
began capering about most obstreperously.</p>
<p>I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof,<lb/>
and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his<lb/>
shipmates by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained<lb/>
from making as much noise as the rest. This man interested<lb/>
me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should<lb/>
soon become my shipmate (though but a sleeping-partner one,<lb/>
so far as this narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon a<lb/>
little description of him. He stood full six feet in height, with<lb/>
noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have seldom<lb/>
seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and<lb/>
burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while<lb/>
in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that<lb/>
did not seem to give him much joy. His voice at once<lb/>
announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature,<lb/>
I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the<lb/>
Alleganian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his compa-<lb/>
nions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unob-<lb/>
served, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade<lb/>
on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his<lb/>
shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite<lb/>
with them, they raised a cry of &#x201C;Bulkington! Bulkington! where&#x0027;s<lb/>
Bulkington?&#x201D; and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.</p>
<p>It was now about nine o&#x0027;clock, and the room seeming almost<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n54" n="17"/>
supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate<lb/>
myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous<lb/>
to the entrance of the seamen.</p>
<p>No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a<lb/>
good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I don&#x0027;t<lb/>
know how it is, but people like to be private when they are<lb/>
sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown<lb/>
stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger<lb/>
a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor<lb/>
was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two<lb/>
in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep<lb/>
two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be<lb/>
sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have<lb/>
your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own<lb/>
blanket, and sleep in your own skin.</p>
<p>The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I<lb/>
abominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to<lb/>
presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the<lb/>
case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the<lb/>
finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late,<lb/>
and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bed-<lb/>
wards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight<lb/>
&#x2014;how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?<lb/>
&#x201C;Landlord! I&#x0027;ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.<lb/>
&#x2014;I shan&#x0027;t sleep with him. I&#x0027;ll try the bench here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Just as you please; I&#x0027;m sorry I cant spare ye a table-<lb/>
cloth for a mattress, and it&#x0027;s a plaguy rough board here&#x201D;&#x2014;<lb/>
feeling of the knots and notches. &#x201C;But wait a bit, Skrimshander;<lb/>
I&#x0027;ve got a carpenter&#x0027;s plane there in the bar&#x2014;wait, I say, and<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll make ye snug enough.&#x201D; So saying he procured the plane;<lb/>
and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench,<lb/>
vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning<lb/>
like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the<lb/>
plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n55" n="18"/>
landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for<lb/>
heaven&#x0027;s sake to quit&#x2014;the bed was soft enough to suit me, and<lb/>
I did not know how all the planing in the world could make<lb/>
eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the shavings with<lb/>
another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the<lb/>
middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in<lb/>
a brown study.</p>
<p>I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was<lb/>
a foot too short; but that could be mended with a chair. But<lb/>
it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was<lb/>
about four inches higher than the planed one&#x2014;so there was no<lb/>
yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise along<lb/>
the only clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval<lb/>
between, for my back to settle down in. But I soon found that<lb/>
there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the<lb/>
sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,<lb/>
especially as another current from the rickety door met the<lb/>
one from the window, and both together formed a series of<lb/>
small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I<lb/>
had thought to spend the night.</p>
<p>The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn&#x0027;t<lb/>
I steal a march on him&#x2014;bolt his door inside, and jump into<lb/>
his bed, not to be wakened by the most violent knockings? It<lb/>
seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.<lb/>
For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I<lb/>
popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in<lb/>
the entry, all ready to knock me down!</p>
<p>Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance<lb/>
of spending a sufferable night unless in some other person&#x0027;s bed,<lb/>
I began to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrant-<lb/>
able prejudices against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I,<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long. I&#x0027;ll have<lb/>
a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly<lb/>
good bedfellows after all&#x2014;there&#x0027;s no telling.</p>
<pb xml:id="n56" n="19"/>
<p>But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos,<lb/>
and threes, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord!&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;what sort of a chap is he&#x2014;does he<lb/>
always keep such late hours?&#x201D; It was now hard upon twelve<lb/>
o&#x0027;clock.</p>
<p>The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and<lb/>
seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my com-<lb/>
prehension. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; he answered, &#x201C;generally he&#x0027;s an early<lb/>
bird&#x2014;airley to bed and airley to rise&#x2014;yes, he&#x0027;s the bird what<lb/>
catches the worm.&#x2014;But to-night he went out a peddling, you<lb/>
see, and I don&#x0027;t see what on airth keeps him so late, unless, may<lb/>
be, he can&#x0027;t sell his head.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can&#x0027;t sell his head?&#x2014;What sort of a bamboozingly story<lb/>
is this you are telling me?&#x201D; getting into a towering rage. &#x201C;Do<lb/>
you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually<lb/>
engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning,<lb/>
in peddling his head around this town?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x0027;s precisely it,&#x201D; said the landlord, &#x201C;and I told him he<lb/>
couldn&#x0027;t sell it here, the market&#x0027;s overstocked.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;With what?&#x201D; shouted I.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With heads to be sure; ain&#x0027;t there too many heads in the<lb/>
world?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I tell you what it is, landlord,&#x201D; said I, quite calmly, &#x201C;you&#x0027;d<lb/>
better stop spinning that yarn to me&#x2014;I&#x0027;m not green.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;May be not,&#x201D; taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick,<lb/>
&#x201C;but I rayther guess you&#x0027;ll be done <hi rend="i">brown</hi> if that ere harpoon-<lb/>
eer hears you a slanderin&#x0027; his head.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x0027;ll break it for him,&#x201D; said I, now flying into a passion again<lb/>
at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord&#x0027;s.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x0027;s broke a&#x0027;ready,&#x201D; said he.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Broke,&#x201D; said I&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="i">broke</hi>, do you mean?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sartain, and that&#x0027;s the very reason he can&#x0027;t sell it, I guess.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord,&#x201D; said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in<lb/>
a snow storm,&#x2014;&#x201C;landlord, stop whittling. You and I must<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n57" n="20"/>
understand one another, and that too without delay. I come<lb/>
to your house and want a bed; you tell me you can only give<lb/>
me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain har-<lb/>
pooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet<lb/>
seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exaspe-<lb/>
rating stories, tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling<lb/>
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow&#x2014;a sort of<lb/>
connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one<lb/>
in the highest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and<lb/>
tell me who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be<lb/>
in all respects safe to spend the night with him. And in the<lb/>
first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story about sell-<lb/>
ing his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this<lb/>
harpooneer is stark mad, and I&#x0027;ve no idea of sleeping with a<lb/>
madman; and you, sir, <hi rend="i">you</hi> I mean, landlord, <hi rend="i">you</hi>, sir, by trying<lb/>
to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself<lb/>
liable to a criminal prosecution.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wall,&#x201D; said the landlord, fetching a long breath, &#x201C;that&#x0027;s a<lb/>
purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.<lb/>
But be easy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin&#x0027;<lb/>
you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up<lb/>
a lot of &#x0027;balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know),<lb/>
and he&#x0027;s sold all on &#x0027;em but one, and that one he&#x0027;s trying to sell<lb/>
to-night, cause to-morrow&#x0027;s Sunday, and it would not do to be<lb/>
sellin&#x0027; human heads about the streets when folks is goin&#x0027; to<lb/>
churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just<lb/>
as he was goin&#x0027; out of the door with four heads strung on a<lb/>
string, for all the airth like a string of inions.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery,<lb/>
and showed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of foo-<lb/>
ling me&#x2014;but at the same time what could I think of a harpoon-<lb/>
eer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sab-<lb/>
bath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads<lb/>
of dead idolators?</p>
<pb xml:id="n58" n="21"/>
<p>&#x201C;Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous<lb/>
man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He pays reg&#x0027;lar,&#x201D; was the rejoinder. &#x201C;But come, it&#x0027;s getting<lb/>
dreadful late, you had better be turning flukes&#x2014;it&#x0027;s a nice bed:<lb/>
Sall and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.<lb/>
There&#x0027;s plenty room for two to kick about in that bed; it&#x0027;s an<lb/>
almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to<lb/>
put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a<lb/>
dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got<lb/>
pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter<lb/>
that, Sal said it wouldn&#x0027;t do. Come along here, I&#x0027;ll give ye a<lb/>
glim in a jiffy;&#x201D; and so saying he lighted a candle and held it<lb/>
towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute;<lb/>
when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed &#x201C;I vum it&#x0027;s<lb/>
Sunday&#x2014;you won&#x0027;t see that harpooneer to-night; he&#x0027;s come to<lb/>
anchor somewhere&#x2014;come along then; <hi rend="i">do</hi> come; <hi rend="i">won&#x0027;t</hi> ye<lb/>
come?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we<lb/>
went, and I was ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and<lb/>
furnished, sure enough, with a prodigious bed, almost big<lb/>
enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There,&#x201D; said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy<lb/>
old sea chest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre<lb/>
table; &#x201C;there, make yourself comfortable now, and good night<lb/>
to ye.&#x201D; I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had disap-<lb/>
peared.</p>
<p>Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.<lb/>
Though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny<lb/>
tolerably well. I then glanced round the room; and besides<lb/>
the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture be-<lb/>
longing to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a<lb/>
papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of<lb/>
things not properly belonging to the room, there was a ham-<lb/>
mock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n59" n="22"/>
a large seaman&#x0027;s bag, containing the harpooneer&#x0027;s wardrobe, no<lb/>
doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of<lb/>
outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and<lb/>
a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.</p>
<p>But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it<lb/>
close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every<lb/>
way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concern-<lb/>
ing it. I can compare it to nothing but a large door mat,<lb/>
ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like<lb/>
the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There<lb/>
was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same<lb/>
in South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any<lb/>
sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the<lb/>
streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on,<lb/>
to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncom-<lb/>
monly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though<lb/>
this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.<lb/>
I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never<lb/>
saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a<lb/>
hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.</p>
<p>I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking<lb/>
about this head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After<lb/>
thinking some time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my<lb/>
monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of the room think-<lb/>
ing. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my<lb/>
shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half un-<lb/>
dressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said<lb/>
about the harpooneer&#x0027;s not coming home at all that night, it being<lb/>
so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my panta-<lb/>
loons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into<lb/>
bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.</p>
<p>Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken<lb/>
crockery, there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and<lb/>
could not sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n60" n="23"/>
doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land<lb/>
of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw<lb/>
a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.</p>
<p>Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer,<lb/>
the infernal head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and<lb/>
resolved not to say a word till spoken to. Holding a light<lb/>
in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the<lb/>
other, the stranger entered the room, and without looking<lb/>
towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on<lb/>
the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the<lb/>
knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the<lb/>
room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it<lb/>
averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag&#x0027;s<lb/>
mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round&#x2014;when,<lb/>
good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark,<lb/>
purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck over with large,<lb/>
blackish looking squares. Yes, it&#x0027;s just as I thought, he&#x0027;s a<lb/>
terrible bedfellow; he&#x0027;s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and<lb/>
here he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he<lb/>
chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw<lb/>
they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on<lb/>
his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first<lb/>
I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the<lb/>
truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man<lb/>
&#x2014;a whaleman too&#x2014;who, falling among the cannibals, had been<lb/>
tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the<lb/>
course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar<lb/>
adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It&#x0027;s only his<lb/>
outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then,<lb/>
what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I<lb/>
mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the<lb/>
squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a<lb/>
good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun&#x0027;s<lb/>
tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n61" n="24"/>
had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there<lb/>
produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while<lb/>
all these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this har-<lb/>
pooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty<lb/>
having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and pre-<lb/>
sently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet<lb/>
with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle<lb/>
of the room, he then took the New Zealand head&#x2014;a ghastly<lb/>
thing enough&#x2014;and crammed it down into the bag. He now<lb/>
took off his hat&#x2014;a new beaver hat&#x2014;when I came nigh singing<lb/>
out with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head&#x2014;none<lb/>
to speak of at least&#x2014;nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up<lb/>
on his forehead. His bald purplish head now looked for all<lb/>
the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood<lb/>
between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker<lb/>
than ever I bolted a dinner.</p>
<p>Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the<lb/>
window, but it was the second floor back. I am no coward,<lb/>
but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether<lb/>
passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear, and<lb/>
being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger,<lb/>
I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil<lb/>
himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of<lb/>
night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game<lb/>
enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory<lb/>
answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at<lb/>
last showed his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts<lb/>
of him were checkered with the same squares as his face; his<lb/>
back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seemed to<lb/>
have been in a Thirty Years&#x0027; War, and just escaped from it with<lb/>
a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked,<lb/>
as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks<lb/>
of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n62" n="25"/>
abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in<lb/>
the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I<lb/>
quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too&#x2014;perhaps the<lb/>
heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine&#x2014;<lb/>
heavens! look at that tomahawk!</p>
<p>But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage<lb/>
went about something that completely fascinated my attention,<lb/>
and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going<lb/>
to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had<lb/>
previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and pro-<lb/>
duced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch<lb/>
on its back, and exactly the color of a three days&#x0027; old Congo<lb/>
baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost<lb/>
thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved<lb/>
in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all<lb/>
limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I<lb/>
concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which<lb/>
indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the<lb/>
empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up<lb/>
this little hunchbacked image, like a tenpin, between the<lb/>
andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were<lb/>
very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appro-<lb/>
priate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.</p>
<p>I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image,<lb/>
feeling but ill at ease meantime&#x2014;to see what was next to<lb/>
follow. First he takes about a double handful of shavings out<lb/>
of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol;<lb/>
then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame<lb/>
from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze.<lb/>
Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still<lb/>
hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be<lb/>
scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the<lb/>
biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a<lb/>
polite offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n63" n="26"/>
seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his<lb/>
lips. All these strange antics were accompanied by still<lb/>
stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be<lb/>
praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or<lb/>
other, during which his face twitched about in the most<lb/>
unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the<lb/>
idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego<lb/>
pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead<lb/>
woodcock.</p>
<p>All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness,<lb/>
and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding<lb/>
his business operations, and jumping into bed with me, I<lb/>
thought it was high time, now or never, before the light was put<lb/>
out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.</p>
<p>But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a<lb/>
fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he<lb/>
examined the head of it for an instant, and then holding it to<lb/>
the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great<lb/>
clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was<lb/>
extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his<lb/>
teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help<lb/>
it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began<lb/>
feeling me.</p>
<p>Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away<lb/>
from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or<lb/>
whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and<lb/>
light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me<lb/>
at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who-e debel you?&#x201D;&#x2014;he at last said&#x2014;&#x201C;you no speak-e,<lb/>
dam-me, I kill-e.&#x201D; And so saying the lighted tomahawk began<lb/>
flourishing about me in the dark.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord, for God&#x0027;s sake, Peter Coffin!&#x201D; shouted I. &#x201C;Land-<lb/>
lord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!&#x201D; again<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n64" n="27"/>
growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the<lb/>
tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I<lb/>
thought my linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at<lb/>
that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand,<lb/>
and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t be afraid now,&#x201D; said he, grinning again. &#x201C;Queequeg<lb/>
here wouldn&#x0027;t harm a hair of your head.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stop your grinning,&#x201D; shouted I, &#x201C;and why didn&#x0027;t you tell<lb/>
me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought ye know&#x0027;d it;&#x2014;didn&#x0027;t I tell ye, he was a peddlin&#x0027;<lb/>
heads around town?&#x2014;but turn flukes again and go to sleep.<lb/>
Queequeg, look here&#x2014;you sabbee me, I sabbee you&#x2014;this man<lb/>
sleepe you&#x2014;you sabbee?&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Me sabbee plenty&#x201D;&#x2014;grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his<lb/>
pipe and sitting up in bed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You gettee in,&#x201D; he added, motioning to me with his toma-<lb/>
hawk, and throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this<lb/>
in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way. I<lb/>
stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was<lb/>
on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What&#x0027;s all this<lb/>
fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself&#x2014;the man&#x0027;s<lb/>
a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to<lb/>
fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a<lb/>
sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;tell him to stash his tomahawk there,<lb/>
or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in<lb/>
short, and I will turn in with him. But I don&#x0027;t fancy having a<lb/>
man smoking in bed with me. It&#x0027;s dangerous. Besides, I aint<lb/>
insured.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again<lb/>
politely motioned me to get into bed&#x2014;rolling over to one side<lb/>
as much as to say&#x2014;I wont touch a leg of ye.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good night, landlord,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;you may go.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I turned in, and never slept better in my life.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the counterpane</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Upon</hi> waking next morning about daylight, I found Quee-<lb/>
queg&#x0027;s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate<lb/>
manner. You had almost thought I had been his wife. The<lb/>
counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored<lb/>
squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with<lb/>
an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of<lb/>
which were of one precise shade&#x2014;owing I suppose to his keep-<lb/>
ing his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt<lb/>
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times&#x2014;this same arm of<lb/>
his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same<lb/>
patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did<lb/>
when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they<lb/>
so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense<lb/>
of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was<lb/>
hugging me.</p>
<p>My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them.<lb/>
When I was a child, I well remember a somewhat similar cir-<lb/>
cumstance that befell me; whether it was a reality or a dream,<lb/>
I never could entirely settle. The circumstance was this. I<lb/>
had been cutting up some caper or other&#x2014;I think it was<lb/>
trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep do<lb/>
a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or<lb/>
other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed<lb/>
supperless,&#x2014;my mother dragged me by the legs out of the<lb/>
chimney and packed me off to bed, though it was only two<lb/>
o&#x0027;clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in<lb/>
the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was<lb/>
no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n66" n="29"/>
floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,<lb/>
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.</p>
<p>I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must<lb/>
elapse before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in<lb/>
bed! the small of my back ached to think of it. And it was<lb/>
so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and a great<lb/>
rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices<lb/>
all over the house. I felt worse and worse&#x2014;at last I got up,<lb/>
dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out<lb/>
my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet, beseech-<lb/>
ing her as a particular favor to give me a good slippering for<lb/>
my misbehavior; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed<lb/>
such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and<lb/>
most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my<lb/>
room. For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a<lb/>
great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from the<lb/>
greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen<lb/>
into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from<lb/>
it&#x2014;half steeped in dreams&#x2014;I opened my eyes, and the before<lb/>
sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I<lb/>
felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be<lb/>
seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand<lb/>
seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,<lb/>
and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to<lb/>
which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-<lb/>
side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen<lb/>
with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand;<lb/>
yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the<lb/>
horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this conscious-<lb/>
ness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning,<lb/>
I shudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and<lb/>
months afterwards I lost myself in confounding attempts to<lb/>
explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle<lb/>
myself with it.</p>
<pb xml:id="n67" n="30"/>
<p>Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling<lb/>
the supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangen-<lb/>
ess, to those which I experienced on waking up and seeing<lb/>
Queequeg&#x0027;s pagan arm thrown round me. But at length all<lb/>
the past night&#x0027;s events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed<lb/>
reality, and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament.<lb/>
For though I tried to move his arm&#x2014;unlock his bridegroom<lb/>
clasp&#x2014;yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly, as<lb/>
though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to<lb/>
rouse him&#x2014; &#x201C;Queequeg!&#x201D;&#x2014;but his only answer was a snore. I<lb/>
then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar;<lb/>
and suddenly felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counter-<lb/>
pane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage&#x0027;s side, as<lb/>
if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought<lb/>
I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a canni-<lb/>
bal and a tomahawk! &#x201C;Queequeg!&#x2014;in the name of goodness,<lb/>
Queequeg, wake!&#x201D; At length, by dint of much wriggling, and<lb/>
loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of<lb/>
his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I<lb/>
succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his<lb/>
arm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from<lb/>
the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me,<lb/>
and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how<lb/>
I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of knowing<lb/>
something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Mean-<lb/>
while, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings<lb/>
now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature.<lb/>
When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of<lb/>
his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact;<lb/>
he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and sounds<lb/>
gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first<lb/>
and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apart-<lb/>
ment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,<lb/>
this is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n68" n="31"/>
have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is mar-<lb/>
vellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular<lb/>
compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much<lb/>
civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;<lb/>
staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette mo-<lb/>
tions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breed-<lb/>
ing. Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don&#x0027;t see every<lb/>
day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.</p>
<p>He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a<lb/>
very tall one, by the by, and then&#x2014;still minus his trowsers&#x2014;he<lb/>
hunted up his boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I<lb/>
cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush himself&#x2014;boots<lb/>
in hand, and hat on&#x2014;under the bed; when, from sundry violent<lb/>
gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting<lb/>
himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is<lb/>
auy man required to be private when putting on his boots. But<lb/>
Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition state&#x2014;<lb/>
either caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized<lb/>
to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner.<lb/>
His education was not yet completed. He was an undergradu-<lb/>
ate. If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very pro-<lb/>
bably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but<lb/>
then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have<lb/>
dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he<lb/>
emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over<lb/>
his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if,<lb/>
not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled<lb/>
cowhide ones&#x2014;probably not made to order either&#x2014;rather<lb/>
pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold<lb/>
morning.</p>
<p>Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and<lb/>
that the street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded<lb/>
a plain view into the room, and observing more and more the<lb/>
indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving about with little<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n69" n="32"/>
else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could,<lb/>
to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his<lb/>
pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied, and then pro-<lb/>
ceeded to wash himself. At that time in the morning any<lb/>
Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my<lb/>
amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to<lb/>
his chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and<lb/>
taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre-table,<lb/>
dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face. I was<lb/>
watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he<lb/>
takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden<lb/>
stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and<lb/>
striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigor-<lb/>
ous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks I,<lb/>
Queequeg, this is using Rogers&#x0027;s best cutlery with a vengeance.<lb/>
Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to<lb/>
know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how<lb/>
exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.</p>
<p>The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly<lb/>
marched out of the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey<lb/>
jacket, and sporting his harpoon like a marshal&#x0027;s baton.</p>
</div1>

<head>CHAPTER V.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">breakfast</hi>.</head>
<p>I <hi rend="sc">quickly</hi> followed suit, and descending into the bar-room<lb/>
accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no<lb/>
malice towards him, though he had been skylarking with me not<lb/>
a little in the matter of my bedfellow.</p>
<p>However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather<lb/>
too scarce a good thing; the more&#x0027;s the pity. So, if any one<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n70" n="33"/>
man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to<lb/>
anybody, let him not be backward, but let him cheerfully allow<lb/>
himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the man that<lb/>
has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is<lb/>
more in that man than you perhaps think for.</p>
<p>The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been<lb/>
dropping in the night previous, and whom I had not as yet had<lb/>
a good look at. They were nearly all whalemen; chief mates,<lb/>
and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea<lb/>
coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keep-<lb/>
ers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an<lb/>
unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning<lb/>
gowns.</p>
<p>You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been<lb/>
ashore. This young fellow&#x0027;s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted<lb/>
pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky; he can-<lb/>
not have been three days landed from his Indian voyage. That<lb/>
man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a<lb/>
touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third<lb/>
still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; <hi rend="i">he</hi><lb/>
doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show<lb/>
a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed<lb/>
like the Andes&#x0027; western slope, to show forth in one array, con-<lb/>
trasting climates, zone by zone.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Grub, ho!&#x201D; now cried the landlord, flinging open a door,<lb/>
and in we went to breakfast.</p>
<p>They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become<lb/>
quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not<lb/>
always, though: Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and<lb/>
Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they possessed the<lb/>
least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere crossing of<lb/>
Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking<lb/>
a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart<lb/>
of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo&#x0027;s performances&#x2014;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n71" n="34"/>
this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of<lb/>
attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort<lb/>
of thing is to be had anywhere.</p>
<p>These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance<lb/>
that after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing<lb/>
to hear some good stories about whaling; to my no small sur-<lb/>
prise, nearly every man maintained a profound silence. And not<lb/>
only that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a<lb/>
set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness<lb/>
had boarded great whales on the high seas&#x2014;entire strangers to<lb/>
them&#x2014;and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here<lb/>
they sat at a social breakfast table&#x2014;all of the same calling, all of<lb/>
kindred tastes&#x2014;looking round as sheepishly at each other as<lb/>
though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold<lb/>
among the Green Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful<lb/>
bears, these timid warrior whalemen!</p>
<p>But as for Queequeg&#x2014;why, Queequeg sat there among<lb/>
them&#x2014;at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as<lb/>
an icicle. To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding. His<lb/>
greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing<lb/>
his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without<lb/>
ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent<lb/>
jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards<lb/>
him. But <hi rend="i">that</hi> was certainly very coolly done by him, and<lb/>
every one knows that in most people&#x0027;s estimation, to do anything<lb/>
coolly is to do it genteelly.</p>
<p>We will not speak of all Queequeg&#x0027;s peculiarities here; how<lb/>
he eschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided<lb/>
attention to beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when break-<lb/>
fast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room,<lb/>
lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digest-<lb/>
ing and smoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied<lb/>
out for a stroll.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the street</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">If</hi> I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so<lb/>
outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the<lb/>
polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon<lb/>
departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the<lb/>
streets of New Bedford.</p>
<p>In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable<lb/>
seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts<lb/>
from foreign parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets,<lb/>
Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted<lb/>
ladies. Regent street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays;<lb/>
and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often<lb/>
scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water street<lb/>
and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only<lb/>
sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at<lb/>
street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on<lb/>
their bones unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.</p>
<p>But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatabooarrs, Erromanggoans,<lb/>
Pannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens<lb/>
of the whaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you<lb/>
will see other sights still more curious, certainly more comical.<lb/>
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and<lb/>
New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the<lb/>
fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows<lb/>
who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and<lb/>
snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green<lb/>
Mountains whence they came. In some things you would<lb/>
think them but a few hours old. Look there! that chap strut-<lb/>
ting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and swallow-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n73" n="36"/>
tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here<lb/>
comes another with a sou&#x0027;-wester and a bombazine cloak.</p>
<p>No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one&#x2014;<lb/>
I mean a downright bumpkin dandy&#x2014;a fellow that, in the<lb/>
dog-days, will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of<lb/>
tanning his hands. Now when a country dandy like this takes<lb/>
it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and joins<lb/>
the great whale-fishery, you should see the comical things he<lb/>
does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit,<lb/>
he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his canvas<lb/>
trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those<lb/>
straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,<lb/>
buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.</p>
<p>But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers,<lb/>
cannibals, and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still<lb/>
New Bedford is a queer place. Had it not been for us whale-<lb/>
men, that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as<lb/>
howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it is, parts of<lb/>
her back country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony.<lb/>
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in, in all<lb/>
New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like<lb/>
Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not<lb/>
run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with<lb/>
fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will<lb/>
you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more<lb/>
opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how<lb/>
planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?</p>
<p>Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round<lb/>
yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered.<lb/>
Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the<lb/>
Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all, they were<lb/>
harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea.<lb/>
Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?</p>
<p>In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n74" n="37"/>
their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises<lb/>
a-piece. You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wed-<lb/>
ding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house,<lb/>
and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti<lb/>
candles.</p>
<p>In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine<lb/>
maples&#x2014;long avenues of green and gold. And in August,<lb/>
high in air, the beautiful and bountiful horse-chestnuts, cande-<lb/>
labra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright cones of<lb/>
congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art; which in many<lb/>
a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of<lb/>
flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation&#x0027;s<lb/>
final day.</p>
<p>And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own<lb/>
red roses. But roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine<lb/>
carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh<lb/>
heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot,<lb/>
save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such<lb/>
musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as<lb/>
though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of<lb/>
the Puritanic sands.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the chapel</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">In</hi> this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman&#x0027;s<lb/>
Chapel, and few are the moody fishermen, shortly bound for<lb/>
the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to<lb/>
the spot. I am sure that I did not.</p>
<p>Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out<lb/>
upon this special errand. The sky had changed from clear,<lb/>
sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n75" n="38"/>
shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my way<lb/>
against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered<lb/>
congregation of sailors, and sailors&#x0027; wives and widows. A muf-<lb/>
fled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the<lb/>
storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart<lb/>
from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incom-<lb/>
municable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these<lb/>
silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several<lb/>
marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on<lb/>
either side the pulpit. Three of them ran something like the<lb/>

<p>Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I<lb/>
seated myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised<lb/>
to see Queequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the<lb/>
scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in<lb/>
his countenance. This savage was the only person present who<lb/>
seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one<lb/>
who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid<lb/>
inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the<lb/>
seamen whose names appeared there were now among the con-<lb/>
gregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded<lb/>
accidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women<lb/>
present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some<lb/>
unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were<lb/>
assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those<lb/>
bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed<lb/>
afresh.</p>
<p>Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who<lb/>
standing among flowers can say&#x2014;here, <hi rend="i">here</hi> lies my beloved;<lb/>
ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these.<lb/>
What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover<lb/>
no ashes! What despair in those immovable inscriptions!<lb/>
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that<lb/>
seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n77" n="40"/>
beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. As well<lb/>
might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.</p>
<p>In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are<lb/>
included; why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that<lb/>
they tell no tales, though containing more secrets than the<lb/>
Goodwin Sands; how it is that to his name who yesterday<lb/>
departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel<lb/>
a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for<lb/>
the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the Life<lb/>
Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in<lb/>
what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet<lb/>
lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it<lb/>
is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we<lb/>
nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why<lb/>
all the living so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the<lb/>
rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city. All<lb/>
these things are not without their meanings.</p>
<p>But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even<lb/>
from these dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.</p>
<p>It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of<lb/>
a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the<lb/>
murky light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the<lb/>
whalemen who had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same<lb/>
fate may be thine. But somehow I grew merry again.<lb/>
Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it<lb/>
seems&#x2014;aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet.<lb/>
Yes, there is death in this business of whaling&#x2014;a speechlessly<lb/>
quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then?<lb/>
Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and<lb/>
Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on<lb/>
earth is my true substance. Methinks that in looking at things<lb/>
spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun<lb/>
through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest<lb/>
of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n78" n="41"/>
In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And<lb/>
therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat<lb/>
and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself<lb/>
cannot.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d8" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER VIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the pulpit</hi>.</head>
<p>I <hi rend="sc">had</hi> not been seated very long ere a man of a certain vene-<lb/>
rable robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door<lb/>
flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him<lb/>
by all the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old<lb/>
man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple,<lb/>
so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great<lb/>
favorite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth,<lb/>
but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry.<lb/>
At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy<lb/>
winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems<lb/>
merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures<lb/>
of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly<lb/>
developing bloom&#x2014;the spring verdure peeping forth even<lb/>
beneath February&#x0027;s snow. No one having previously heard his<lb/>
history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without<lb/>
the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical<lb/>
peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime<lb/>
life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried<lb/>
no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his<lb/>
tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot<lb/>
cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the<lb/>
weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat<lb/>
and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n79" n="42"/>
little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent<lb/>
suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.</p>
<p>Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and<lb/>
since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle<lb/>
with the floor, seriously contract the already small area of the<lb/>
chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of<lb/>
Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substi-<lb/>
tuting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting<lb/>
a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had<lb/>
provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-<lb/>
ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and<lb/>
stained with a mahogany color, the whole contrivance, consider-<lb/>
ing what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad<lb/>
taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with<lb/>
both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes,<lb/>
Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-<lb/>
like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the<lb/>
steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.</p>
<p>The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the<lb/>
case with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the<lb/>
rounds were of wood, so that at every step there was a joint.<lb/>
At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that<lb/>
however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present<lb/>
instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared to see<lb/>
Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round,<lb/>
and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by<lb/>
step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregn-<lb/>
able in his little Quebec.</p>
<p>I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason<lb/>
for this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for<lb/>
sincerity and sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting<lb/>
notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I,<lb/>
there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore,<lb/>
it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n80" n="43"/>
that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal<lb/>
for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?<lb/>
Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the<lb/>
faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing strong-<lb/>
hold&#x2014;a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water<lb/>
within the walls.</p>
<p>But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the<lb/>
place, borrowed from the chaplain&#x0027;s former sea-farings. Between<lb/>
the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall<lb/>
which formed its back was adorned with a large painting repre-<lb/>
senting a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee<lb/>
coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the<lb/>
flying seud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of<lb/>
sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel&#x0027;s face; and this<lb/>
bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into<lb/>
the Victory&#x0027;s plank where Nelson fell. &#x201C;Ah, noble ship,&#x201D; the<lb/>
angel seemed to say, &#x201C;beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and<lb/>
bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the<lb/>
clouds are rolling off&#x2014;serenest azure is at hand.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste<lb/>
that had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled<lb/>
front was in the likeness of a ship&#x0027;s bluff bows, and the Holy<lb/>
Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after<lb/>
a ship&#x0027;s fiddle-headed beak.</p>
<p>What could be more full of meaning?&#x2014;for the pulpit is ever<lb/>
this earth&#x0027;s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear;<lb/>
the pulpit leads the world. From thence it is the storm of<lb/>
God&#x0027;s quick wrath is first descried, and the bow must bear the<lb/>
earliest brunt. From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul<lb/>
is first invoked for favorable winds. Yes, the world&#x0027;s a ship on<lb/>
its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and the pulpit<lb/>
is its prow.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the sermon</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Father Mapple</hi> rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming<lb/>
authority ordered the scattered people to condense. &#x201C;Starboard<lb/>
gangway, there! side away to larboard&#x2014;larboard gangway to<lb/>
starboard! Midships! midships!&#x201D;</p>
<p>There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the<lb/>
benches, and a still slighter shuffling of women&#x0027;s shoes, and all<lb/>
was quiet again, and every eye on the preacher.</p>
<p>He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit&#x0027;s bows, folded<lb/>
his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes,<lb/>
and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling<lb/>
and praying at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual toll-<lb/>
ing of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog&#x2014;in such<lb/>
tones he commenced reading the following hymn; but changing<lb/>
his manner towards the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a<lb/>
pealing exultation and joy&#x2014;</p>
<lg type="verse">

</lg>
<p>Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high<lb/>
above the howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the<lb/>
preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last,<lb/>
folding his hand down upon the proper page, said: &#x201C;Beloved<lb/>
shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters&#x2014;four<lb/>
yarns&#x2014;is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the<lb/>
Scriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah&#x0027;s deep sea-<lb/>
line sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What<lb/>
a noble thing is that canticle in the fish&#x0027;s belly! How billow-<lb/>
like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us;<lb/>
we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed<lb/>
and all the slime of the sea is about us! But <hi rend="i">what</hi> is this les-<lb/>
son that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-<lb/>
stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a<lb/>
lesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is<lb/>
a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-hearted-<lb/>
ness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repent-<lb/>
ance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As<lb/>
with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was<lb/>
in his wilful disobedience of the command of God&#x2014;never mind<lb/>
now what that command was, or how conveyed&#x2014;which he<lb/>
found a hard command. But all the things that God would<lb/>
have us do are hard for us to do&#x2014;remember that&#x2014;and hence,<lb/>
he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n83" n="46"/>
we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this<lb/>
disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God con-<lb/>
sists.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts<lb/>
at God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship<lb/>
made by men, will carry him into countries where God does<lb/>
not reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He skulks<lb/>
about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that&#x0027;s bound for<lb/>
Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning<lb/>
here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city<lb/>
than the modern Cadiz. That&#x0027;s the opinion of learned men.<lb/>
And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by<lb/>
water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those<lb/>
ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.<lb/>
Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most<lb/>
easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish<lb/>
or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from<lb/>
that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not then,<lb/>
shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?<lb/>
Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all<lb/>
scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his<lb/>
God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hasten-<lb/>
ing to cross the seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his<lb/>
look, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on<lb/>
the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere<lb/>
he touched a deck. How plainly he&#x0027;s a fugitive! no baggage,<lb/>
not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,&#x2014;no friends accompany<lb/>
him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much<lb/>
dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last<lb/>
items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its Captain<lb/>
in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting<lb/>
in the goods, to mark the stranger&#x0027;s evil eye. Jonah sees<lb/>
this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence;<lb/>
in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n84" n="47"/>
man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their<lb/>
gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x2018;Jack, he&#x0027;s robbed a widow;&#x2019; or, &#x2018;Joe, do you mark him;<lb/>
he&#x0027;s a bigamist;&#x2019; or, &#x2018;Harry lad, I guess he&#x0027;s the adulterer<lb/>
that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing<lb/>
murderers from Sodom.&#x2019; Another runs to read the bill that&#x0027;s<lb/>
stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is<lb/>
moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of<lb/>
a parricide, and containing a description of his person. He<lb/>
reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympa-<lb/>
thetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their<lb/>
hands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all<lb/>
his boldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.<lb/>
He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong<lb/>
suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the sailors<lb/>
find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him<lb/>
pass, and he descends into the cabin.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Who&#x0027;s there?&#x2019; cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly<lb/>
making out his papers for the Customs&#x2014;&#x2018;Who&#x0027;s there?&#x2019;<lb/>
Oh! how that harmless question mangles Jonah! For the<lb/>
instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. &#x2018;I seek<lb/>
a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?&#x2019;<lb/>
Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though<lb/>
the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear<lb/>
that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. &#x2018;We<lb/>
sail with the next coming tide,&#x2019; at last he slowly answered, still<lb/>
intently eyeing him. &#x2018;No sooner, sir?&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2018;Soon enough for<lb/>
any honest man that goes a passenger.&#x2019; Ha! Jonah, that&#x0027;s<lb/>
another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that<lb/>
scent. &#x2018;I&#x0027;ll sail with ye,&#x2019;&#x2014;he says,&#x2014;&#x2018;the passage money,<lb/>
how much is that?&#x2014;I&#x0027;ll pay now.&#x2019; For it is particularly<lb/>
written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in<lb/>
this history, &#x2018;that he paid the fare thereof&#x2019; ere the craft<lb/>
did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of meaning.</p>
<pb xml:id="n85" n="48"/>
<p>Now Jonah&#x0027;s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment<lb/>
detects crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the<lb/>
penniless. In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can<lb/>
travel freely, and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a<lb/>
pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah&#x0027;s Captain pre-<lb/>
pares to test the length of Jonah&#x0027;s purse, ere he judge him<lb/>
openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and it&#x0027;s as-<lb/>
sented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;<lb/>
but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear<lb/>
with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent<lb/>
suspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find<lb/>
a counterfeit. Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah<lb/>
is put down for his passage. &#x2018;Point out my state-room, Sir,&#x2019;<lb/>
says Jonah now, &#x2018;I&#x0027;m travel-weary; I need sleep.&#x2019; &#x2018;Thou<lb/>
look&#x0027;st like it,&#x2019; says the Captain, &#x2018;there&#x0027;s thy room.&#x2019; Jonah<lb/>
enters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key.<lb/>
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly<lb/>
to himself, and mutters something about the doors of convicts&#x0027;<lb/>
cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed and<lb/>
dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds<lb/>
the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The<lb/>
air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole,<lb/>
sunk, too, beneath the ship&#x0027;s water-line. Jonah feels the herald-<lb/>
ing presentiment of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold<lb/>
him in the smallest of his bowel&#x0027;s wards.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly<lb/>
oscillates in Jonah&#x0027;s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the<lb/>
wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame<lb/>
and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obli-<lb/>
quity with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly<lb/>
straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among<lb/>
which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in<lb/>
his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far<lb/>
successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n86" n="49"/>
contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor,<lb/>
the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. &#x2018;Oh! so my conscience<lb/>
hangs in me!&#x2019; he groans, &#x2018;straight upward, so it burns; but<lb/>
the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his<lb/>
bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the<lb/>
plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more<lb/>
strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable<lb/>
plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for<lb/>
annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl<lb/>
of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the<lb/>
man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and<lb/>
there&#x0027;s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,<lb/>
Jonah&#x0027;s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning<lb/>
down to sleep.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her<lb/>
cables; and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for<lb/>
Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea. That ship, my friends,<lb/>
was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.<lb/>
But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A<lb/>
dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to break. But now<lb/>
when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when boxes,<lb/>
bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is<lb/>
shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders<lb/>
with trampling feet right over Jonah&#x0027;s head; in all this raging<lb/>
tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky<lb/>
and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he<lb/>
or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now<lb/>
with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye,<lb/>
shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship&#x2014;<lb/>
a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep.<lb/>
But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his<lb/>
dead ear, &#x2018;What meanest thou, O sleeper! arise!&#x2019; Startled<lb/>
from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n87" n="50"/>
feet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out<lb/>
upon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung upon by a<lb/>
panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave<lb/>
thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs<lb/>
roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning<lb/>
while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her<lb/>
affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead,<lb/>
aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward,<lb/>
but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all<lb/>
his cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly<lb/>
known. The sailors mark him; more and more certain grow<lb/>
their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test the truth, by<lb/>
referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they fall to casting<lb/>
lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them.<lb/>
The lot is Jonah&#x0027;s; that discovered, then how furiously they<lb/>
mob him with their questions. &#x2018;What is thine occupation?<lb/>
Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people?&#x2019; But<lb/>
mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The<lb/>
eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from;<lb/>
whereas, they not only receive an answer to those questions, but<lb/>
likewise another answer to a question not put by them, but the<lb/>
unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand or<lb/>
God that is upon him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;I am a Hebrew,&#x2019; he cries&#x2014;and then&#x2014;&#x2018;I fear the Lord the<lb/>
God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!&#x2019;<lb/>
Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord<lb/>
God <hi rend="i">then!</hi> Straightway, he now goes on to make a full con-<lb/>
fession; whereupon the mariners became more and more<lb/>
appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet sup-<lb/>
plicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the dark-<lb/>
ness of his deserts,&#x2014;when wretched Jonah cries out to them to<lb/>
take him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for<lb/>
<hi rend="i">his</hi> sake this great tempest was upon them; they mercifully<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n88" n="51"/>
turn from him, and seek by other means to save the ship. But<lb/>
all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one<lb/>
hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unre-<lb/>
luctantly lay hold of Jonah.</p>
<p>And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped<lb/>
into the sea; when instantly an oily calmness floats out from<lb/>
the east, and the sea is still, as Jonah carries down the gale<lb/>
with him, leaving smooth water behind. He goes down in the<lb/>
whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce<lb/>
heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning<lb/>
jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory<lb/>
teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah<lb/>
prayed unto the Lord out of the fish&#x0027;s belly. But observe his<lb/>
prayer, and learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah<lb/>
does not weep and wail for direct deliverance. He feels that<lb/>
his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his deliver-<lb/>
ance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his<lb/>
pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple.<lb/>
And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not cla-<lb/>
morous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how<lb/>
pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the<lb/>
eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Ship-<lb/>
mates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin<lb/>
but I do place him before you as a model for repentance. Sin<lb/>
not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While he was speaking these words, the howling of the<lb/>
shrieking, slanting storm without seemed to add new power to<lb/>
the preacher, who, when describing Jonah&#x0027;s sea-storm, seemed<lb/>
tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest heaved as with a<lb/>
ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at<lb/>
work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy<lb/>
brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple<lb/>
hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to<lb/>
them.</p>
<pb xml:id="n89" n="52"/>
<p>There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over<lb/>
the leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing<lb/>
motionless, with closed eyes, for the moment, seemed commun-<lb/>
ing with God and himself.</p>
<p>But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing<lb/>
his head lowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest<lb/>
humility, he spake these words:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his<lb/>
hands press upon me. I have read ye by what murky light<lb/>
may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and<lb/>
therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater sinner<lb/>
than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this<lb/>
mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and<lb/>
listen as you listen, while some one of you reads <hi rend="i">me</hi> that other<lb/>
and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to <hi rend="i">me</hi>, as a pilot of<lb/>
the living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or<lb/>
speaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those<lb/>
unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah,<lb/>
appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from his mission,<lb/>
and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship at<lb/>
Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached.<lb/>
As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swal-<lb/>
lowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slant-<lb/>
ings tore him along &#x2018;into the midst of the seas,&#x2019; where the<lb/>
eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and<lb/>
&#x2018;the weeds were wrapped about his head,&#x2019; and all the watery<lb/>
world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond the<lb/>
reach of any plummet&#x2014;&#x2018;out of the belly of hell&#x2019;&#x2014;when the<lb/>
whale grounded upon the ocean&#x0027;s utmost bones, even then, God<lb/>
heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then<lb/>
God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and<lb/>
blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the<lb/>
warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth;<lb/>
and &#x2018;vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;&#x2019; when the word of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n90" n="53"/>
the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten<lb/>
&#x2014;his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of<lb/>
the ocean&#x2014;Jonah did the Almighty&#x0027;s bidding. And what was<lb/>
that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!<lb/>
That was it!</p>
<p>&#x201C;This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that<lb/>
pilot of the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this<lb/>
world charms from Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to<lb/>
pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a<lb/>
gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal!<lb/>
Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness!<lb/>
Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to<lb/>
him who would not be true, even though to be false were salva-<lb/>
tion! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it,<lb/>
while preaching to others is himself a castaway!&#x201D;</p>
<p>He drooped and fell away from himself for a moment; then<lb/>
lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as<lb/>
he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm,&#x2014;&#x201C;But oh! shipmates!<lb/>
on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and<lb/>
higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is<lb/>
deep. Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? De-<lb/>
light is to him&#x2014;a far, far upward, and inward delight&#x2014;who<lb/>
against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands<lb/>
forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong arms<lb/>
yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world<lb/>
has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no<lb/>
quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin<lb/>
though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and<lb/>
Judges. Delight,&#x2014;top-gallant delight is to him, who acknow-<lb/>
ledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only<lb/>
a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of<lb/>
the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake<lb/>
from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and de-<lb/>
liciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n91" n="54"/>
with his final breath&#x2014;O Father!&#x2014;chiefly known to me by Thy<lb/>
rod&#x2014;mortal or immortal, here I die. I have striven to be<lb/>
Thine, more than to be this world&#x0027;s, or mine own. Yet this is<lb/>
nothing; I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he<lb/>
should live out the lifetime of his God?&#x201D;</p>
<p>He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered<lb/>
his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the<lb/>
people had departed, and he was left alone in the place.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">a bosom friend</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Returning</hi> to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found<lb/>
Queequeg there quite alone; he having left the Chapel before<lb/>
the benediction some time. He was sitting on a bench before<lb/>
the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in one hand was<lb/>
holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his; peering<lb/>
hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away<lb/>
at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish<lb/>
way.</p>
<p>But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty<lb/>
soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and<lb/>
placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate<lb/>
regularity; at every fiftieth page&#x2014;as I fancied&#x2014;stopping a<lb/>
moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to<lb/>
a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then<lb/>
begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number<lb/>
one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty,<lb/>
and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found<lb/>
together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was<lb/>
excited.</p>
<p>With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n92" n="55"/>
was, and hideously marred about the face&#x2014;at least to my<lb/>
taste&#x2014;his countenance yet had a something in it which was by<lb/>
no means disagreeable. You cannot hide the soul. Through<lb/>
all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a<lb/>
simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and<lb/>
bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand<lb/>
devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing<lb/>
about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not alto-<lb/>
gether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed<lb/>
and never had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his<lb/>
head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and<lb/>
brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise<lb/>
would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his<lb/>
head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridi-<lb/>
culous, but it reminded me of General Washington&#x0027;s head, as<lb/>
seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long<lb/>
regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which<lb/>
were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly<lb/>
wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibal-<lb/>
istically developed.</p>
<p>Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending<lb/>
meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement,<lb/>
he never heeded my presence, never troubled himself with so<lb/>
much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with<lb/>
counting the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how<lb/>
sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous, and<lb/>
especially considering the affectionate arm I had found thrown<lb/>
over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indiffer-<lb/>
ence of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at<lb/>
times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first<lb/>
they are overawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity<lb/>
seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that Queequeg<lb/>
never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other seamen<lb/>
in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n93" n="56"/>
no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this<lb/>
struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts,<lb/>
there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man<lb/>
some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape<lb/>
Horn, that is&#x2014;which was the only way he could get there&#x2014;<lb/>
thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in<lb/>
the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;<lb/>
preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own compa-<lb/>
nionship; always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of<lb/>
fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was<lb/>
such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we<lb/>
mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving. So<lb/>
soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a<lb/>
philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he<lb/>
must have &#x201C;broken his digester.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning<lb/>
low, in that mild stage when, after its first intensity has<lb/>
warmed the air, it then only glows to be looked at; the evening<lb/>
shades and phantoms gathering round the casements, and peer-<lb/>
ing in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without<lb/>
in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange feelings. I<lb/>
felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart and mad-<lb/>
dened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This<lb/>
soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indif-<lb/>
ference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized<lb/>
hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of<lb/>
sights to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn<lb/>
towards him. And those same things that would have repelled<lb/>
most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me.<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has<lb/>
proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and<lb/>
made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with<lb/>
him meanwhile. At first he little noticed these advances; but<lb/>
presently, upon my referring to his last night&#x0027;s hospitalities, he<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n94" n="57"/>
made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows.<lb/>
I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps<lb/>
a little complimented.</p>
<p>We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored<lb/>
to explain to him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning<lb/>
of the few pictures that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his<lb/>
interest; and from that we went to jabbering the best we<lb/>
could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous<lb/>
town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing his<lb/>
pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then<lb/>
we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping<lb/>
it regularly passing between us.</p>
<p>If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the<lb/>
Pagan&#x0027;s breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed<lb/>
it out, and left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as<lb/>
naturally and unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke<lb/>
was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me<lb/>
round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married;<lb/>
meaning, in his country&#x0027;s phrase, that we were bosom friends;<lb/>
he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a country-<lb/>
man, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far<lb/>
too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple<lb/>
savage those old rules would not apply.</p>
<p>After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to<lb/>
our room together. He made me a present of his embalmed<lb/>
head; took out his enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under<lb/>
the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver; then<lb/>
spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them<lb/>
into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and<lb/>
said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he silenced<lb/>
me by pouring them into my trowsers&#x0027; pockets. I let them stay.<lb/>
He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and<lb/>
removed the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms,<lb/>
I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n95" n="58"/>
knowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether,<lb/>
in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.</p>
<p>I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the<lb/>
infallible Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with<lb/>
this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what<lb/>
is worship? thought I. Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the<lb/>
magnanimous God of heaven and earth&#x2014;pagans and all in-<lb/>
cluded&#x2014;can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black<lb/>
wood? Impossible! But what is worship?&#x2014;to do the will of<lb/>
God&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that</hi> is worship. And what is the will of God?&#x2014;to do<lb/>
to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to<lb/>
me&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that</hi> is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow<lb/>
man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to<lb/>
me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form<lb/>
of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him in his;<lb/>
ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped<lb/>
prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with<lb/>
Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose;<lb/>
and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with<lb/>
our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to<lb/>
sleep without some little chat.</p>
<p>How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for<lb/>
confidential disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they<lb/>
say, there open the very bottom of their souls to each other;<lb/>
and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till<lb/>
nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts&#x0027; honeymoon, lay I<lb/>
and Queequeg&#x2014;a cosy, loving pair.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d11" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">nightgown</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">We</hi> had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short<lb/>
intervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n96" n="59"/>
his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back;<lb/>
so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when, at last,<lb/>
by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained<lb/>
in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again,<lb/>
though day-break was yet some way down the future.</p>
<p>Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recum-<lb/>
bent position began to grow wearisome, and by little and little<lb/>
we found ourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around<lb/>
us, leaning against the head-board with our four knees drawn<lb/>
up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if<lb/>
our knee-pans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug,<lb/>
the more so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of<lb/>
bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the room. The<lb/>
more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some<lb/>
small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this<lb/>
world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists<lb/>
in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfort-<lb/>
able, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to<lb/>
be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the<lb/>
bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly<lb/>
chilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel<lb/>
most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a<lb/>
sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which<lb/>
is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height<lb/>
of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket<lb/>
between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air.<lb/>
Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an<lb/>
arctic crystal.</p>
<p>We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time,<lb/>
when all at once I thought I would open my eyes; for when<lb/>
between sheets, whether by day or by night, and whether asleep<lb/>
or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut, in order<lb/>
the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because<lb/>
no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n97" n="60"/>
closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our<lb/>
essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part.<lb/>
Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleas-<lb/>
ant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer<lb/>
gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o&#x0027;clock-at-night, I experi-<lb/>
enced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the<lb/>
hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,<lb/>
seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong<lb/>
desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it<lb/>
said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smok-<lb/>
ing in the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff pre-<lb/>
judices grow when love once comes to bend them. For now<lb/>
I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,<lb/>
even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene house-<lb/>
hold joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the land-<lb/>
lord&#x0027;s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed<lb/>
confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with<lb/>
a real friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our<lb/>
shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other,<lb/>
till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke,<lb/>
illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.</p>
<p>Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage<lb/>
away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his<lb/>
native island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to<lb/>
go on and tell it. He gladly complied. Though at the time I<lb/>
but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent<lb/>
disclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken<lb/>
phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as<lb/>
it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.</p>

<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d12" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">biographical</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Queequeg</hi> was a native of Kokovoko, an island far away to<lb/>
the West and South. It is not down in any map; true places<lb/>
never are.</p>
<p>When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native<lb/>
woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if<lb/>
he were a green sapling; even then, in Queequeg&#x0027;s ambitious<lb/>
soul, lurked a strong desire to see something more of Christendom<lb/>
than a specimen whaler or two. His father was a High Chief,<lb/>
a King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he<lb/>
boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors.<lb/>
There was excellent blood in his veins&#x2014;royal stuff; though<lb/>
sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he nourished<lb/>
in his untutored youth.</p>
<p>A Sag Harbor ship visited his father&#x0027;s bay, and Queequeg<lb/>
sought a passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her<lb/>
full complement of seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the<lb/>
King his father&#x0027;s influence could prevail. But Queequeg<lb/>
vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant<lb/>
strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when she<lb/>
quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other<lb/>
a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that<lb/>
grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among<lb/>
these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern,<lb/>
paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a<lb/>
flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash<lb/>
of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains;<lb/>
and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n99" n="62"/>
ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in<lb/>
pieces.</p>
<p>In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard;<lb/>
suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the<lb/>
son of a King, and Queequeg budged not. Struck by his<lb/>
desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit Christendom,<lb/>
the captain at last relented, and told him he might make him-<lb/>
self at home. But this fine young savage&#x2014;this sea Prince of<lb/>
Wales, never saw the captain&#x0027;s cabin. They put him down<lb/>
among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like<lb/>
Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,<lb/>
Queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might<lb/>
happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored country-<lb/>
men. For at bottom&#x2014;so he told me&#x2014;he was actuated by a<lb/>
profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby<lb/>
to make his people still happier than they were; and more than<lb/>
that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of<lb/>
whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be<lb/>
both miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his<lb/>
father&#x0027;s heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing<lb/>
what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket,<lb/>
and seeing how they spent their wages in <hi rend="i">that</hi> place also, poor<lb/>
Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it&#x0027;s a wicked world<lb/>
in all meridians; I&#x0027;ll die a pagan.</p>
<p>And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these<lb/>
Christians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.<lb/>
Hence the queer ways about him, though now some time from<lb/>
home.</p>
<p>By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going<lb/>
back, and having a coronation; since he might now consider<lb/>
his father dead and gone, he being very old and feeble at the<lb/>
last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and added that he<lb/>
was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted him<lb/>
for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n100" n="63"/>
Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,&#x2014;as<lb/>
soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however,<lb/>
he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four<lb/>
oceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed<lb/>
iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.</p>
<p>I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching<lb/>
his future movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his<lb/>
old vocation. Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own<lb/>
design, and informed him of my intention to sail out of<lb/>
Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous<lb/>
whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany<lb/>
me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same<lb/>
watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share<lb/>
my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the<lb/>
Potluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for<lb/>
besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an<lb/>
experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of<lb/>
great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of<lb/>
the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea,<lb/>
as known to merchant seamen.</p>
<p>His story being ended with his pipe&#x0027;s last dying puff,<lb/>
Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and<lb/>
blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, this way<lb/>
and that, and very soon were sleeping.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">wheelbarrow</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Next</hi> morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head<lb/>
to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade&#x0027;s bill;<lb/>
using, however, my comrade&#x0027;s money. The grinning landlord,<lb/>
as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n101" n="64"/>
friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg&#x2014;<lb/>
specially as Peter Coffin&#x0027;s cock and bull stories about him had<lb/>
previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person<lb/>
whom I now companied with.</p>
<p>We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, in-<lb/>
cluding my own poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg&#x0027;s canvas sack<lb/>
and hammock, away we went down to &#x201C;the Moss,&#x201D; the little<lb/>
Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As we were<lb/>
going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much&#x2014;<lb/>
or they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,<lb/>
&#x2014;but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.<lb/>
But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by<lb/>
turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the<lb/>
sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he carried<lb/>
such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all<lb/>
whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in<lb/>
substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true<lb/>
enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon,<lb/>
because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal<lb/>
combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In short,<lb/>
like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the<lb/>
farmers&#x0027; meadows armed with their own scythes&#x2014;though in no<lb/>
wise obliged to furnish them&#x2014;even so, Queequeg, for his own<lb/>
private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.</p>
<p>Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny<lb/>
story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in<lb/>
Sag Harbor. The owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him<lb/>
one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house.<lb/>
Not to seem ignorant about the thing&#x2014;though in truth he was<lb/>
entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the<lb/>
barrow&#x2014;Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and<lb/>
then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. &#x201C;Why,&#x201D;<lb/>
said I, &#x201C;Queequeg, you might have known better than that,<lb/>
one would think. Didn&#x0027;t the people laugh?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n102" n="65"/>
<p>Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his<lb/>
island of Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express<lb/>
the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained<lb/>
calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl always<lb/>
forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the<lb/>
feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once touched<lb/>
at Rokovoko, and its commander&#x2014;from all accounts, a very<lb/>
stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain&#x2014;this<lb/>
commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg&#x0027;s<lb/>
sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when<lb/>
all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride&#x0027;s bamboo<lb/>
cottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post<lb/>
of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and be-<lb/>
tween the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg&#x0027;s<lb/>
father. Grace being said,&#x2014;for those people have their grace<lb/>
as well as we&#x2014;though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who<lb/>
at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the<lb/>
contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver<lb/>
of all feasts&#x2014;Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens<lb/>
the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is,<lb/>
dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the<lb/>
bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself<lb/>
placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking<lb/>
himself&#x2014;being Captain of a ship&#x2014;as having plain precedence<lb/>
over a mere island King, especially in the King&#x0027;s own house&#x2014;<lb/>
he Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punch<lb/>
bowl;&#x2014;taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. &#x201C;Now,&#x201D;<lb/>
said Queequeg, &#x201C;what you tink now?&#x2014;Didn&#x0027;t our people<lb/>
laugh?&#x201D;</p>
<p>At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board<lb/>
the schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet<lb/>
river. On one side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets,<lb/>
their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.<lb/>
Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n103" n="66"/>
wharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships<lb/>
lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others came<lb/>
a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires<lb/>
and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new<lb/>
cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long<lb/>
voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only<lb/>
begins a third, and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the<lb/>
endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.</p>
<p>Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed<lb/>
fresh; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as<lb/>
a young colt his snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air<lb/>
&#x2014;how I spurned that turnpike earth!&#x2014;that common highway<lb/>
all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and<lb/>
turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will<lb/>
permit no records.</p>
<p>At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and<lb/>
reel with me. His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed<lb/>
his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing<lb/>
gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived<lb/>
her brows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning,<lb/>
we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the<lb/>
two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So<lb/>
full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging<lb/>
bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances<lb/>
of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that<lb/>
two fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a<lb/>
white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed<lb/>
negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,<lb/>
by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and<lb/>
centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young<lb/>
saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bump-<lb/>
kin&#x0027;s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the<lb/>
brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost mira-<lb/>
culous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n104" n="67"/>
air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow<lb/>
landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turn-<lb/>
ing his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed<lb/>
it to me for a puff.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Capting! Capting!&#x201D; yelled the bumpkin, running towards<lb/>
that officer; &#x201C;Capting, Capting, here&#x0027;s the devil.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hallo, <hi rend="i">you</hi> sir,&#x201D; cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea,<lb/>
stalking up to Queequeg, &#x201C;what in thunder do you mean<lb/>
by that? Don&#x0027;t you know you might have killed that chap?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What him say?&#x201D; said Queequeg, as he mildly turned<lb/>
to me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He say,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;that you came near kill-e that man there,&#x201D;<lb/>
pointing to the still shivering greenhorn.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Kill-e,&#x201D; cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an<lb/>
unearthly expression of disdain, &#x201C;ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;<lb/>
Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big<lb/>
whale!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look you,&#x201D; roared the Captain, &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll kill-e <hi rend="i">you</hi>, you canni-<lb/>
al, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind<lb/>
your eye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the<lb/>
Captain to mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the<lb/>
main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous<lb/>
boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping<lb/>
the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom<lb/>
Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all<lb/>
hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom<lb/>
to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back<lb/>
again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed<lb/>
on the point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and<lb/>
nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed<lb/>
towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the<lb/>
lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this con-<lb/>
sternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n105" n="68"/>
under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured<lb/>
one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,<lb/>
caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the<lb/>
next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The<lb/>
schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were<lb/>
clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist,<lb/>
darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For three<lb/>
minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing<lb/>
his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing<lb/>
his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked<lb/>
at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.<lb/>
The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpen-<lb/>
dicularly from the water, Queequeg now took an instant&#x0027;s<lb/>
glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were,<lb/>
dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he<lb/>
rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other drag-<lb/>
ging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor<lb/>
bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble<lb/>
trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I<lb/>
clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took<lb/>
his last long dive.</p>
<p>Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to<lb/>
think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and<lb/>
Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for water&#x2014;fresh water<lb/>
&#x2014;something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry<lb/>
clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and<lb/>
mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to himself<lb/>
&#x2014;&#x201C;It&#x0027;s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We can-<lb/>
nibals must help these Christians.&#x201D;</p>

<hi rend="sc">nantucket</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Nothing</hi> more happened on the passage worthy the men-<lb/>
tioning; so, after a fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.</p>
<p>Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a<lb/>
real corner of the world it occupies; how it stands there, away<lb/>
off shore, more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at<lb/>
it&#x2014;a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach, without a<lb/>
background. There is more sand there than you would use in<lb/>
twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some<lb/>
gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds<lb/>
there, they don&#x0027;t grow naturally; that they import Canada<lb/>
thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop<lb/>
a leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are<lb/>
carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people<lb/>
there plant toadstools before their houses, to get under the<lb/>
shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an<lb/>
oasis, three blades in a day&#x0027;s walk a prairie; that they<lb/>
wear quicksand shoes, something like Laplander snow-<lb/>
hoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every way<lb/>
inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean,<lb/>
that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes<lb/>
be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these<lb/>
extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.</p>
<p>Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this<lb/>
island was settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In<lb/>
olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England<lb/>
coast, and carried off an infant Indian in his talons. With loud<lb/>
lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n107" n="70"/>
wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same direction.<lb/>
Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they dis-<lb/>
covered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,<lb/>
&#x2014;the poor little Indian&#x0027;s skeleton.</p>
<p>What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a<lb/>
beach, should take to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught<lb/>
crabs and quohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out<lb/>
with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in<lb/>
boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great<lb/>
ships on the sea, explored this watery world; put an incessant<lb/>
belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at Bhering&#x0027;s Straits;<lb/>
and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with<lb/>
the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most<lb/>
monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea<lb/>
Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious<lb/>
power, that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his<lb/>
most fearless and malicious assaults!</p>
<p>And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits,<lb/>
issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered<lb/>
the watery world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out<lb/>
among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the<lb/>
three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to<lb/>
Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm<lb/>
all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two<lb/>
thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer&#x0027;s. For the<lb/>
sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen<lb/>
having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are but<lb/>
extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates<lb/>
and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the<lb/>
road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land<lb/>
like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the<lb/>
bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and<lb/>
riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it<lb/>
in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n108" n="71"/>
<hi rend="i">There</hi> is his home; <hi rend="i">there</hi> lies his business, which a Noah&#x0027;s<lb/>
flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions<lb/>
in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie;<lb/>
he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters<lb/>
climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that<lb/>
when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more<lb/>
strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the<lb/>
landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to<lb/>
sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of<lb/>
sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while<lb/>
under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">chowder</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came<lb/>
snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could<lb/>
attend to no business that day, at least none but a supper and<lb/>
a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us<lb/>
to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to<lb/>
be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket,<lb/>
and moreover he had assured us that cousin Hosea, as he called<lb/>
him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he plainly hinted<lb/>
that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at the<lb/>
Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a<lb/>
yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white<lb/>
church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard<lb/>
hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and<lb/>
that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was:<lb/>
these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first,<lb/>
especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow<lb/>
warehouse&#x2014;our first point of departure&#x2014;must be left on the lar-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n109" n="72"/>
board hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it<lb/>
was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a<lb/>
little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable<lb/>
inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something<lb/>
which there was no mistaking.</p>
<p>Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by<lb/>
asses&#x0027; ears, swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast,<lb/>
planted in front of an old doorway. The horns of the cross-<lb/>
rees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old top-mast<lb/>
looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensi-<lb/>
tive to such impressions at the time, but I could not help staring<lb/>
at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in<lb/>
my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, <hi rend="i">two</hi> of<lb/>
them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It&#x0027;s ominous, thinks<lb/>
I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling<lb/>
port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen&#x0027;s chapel; and<lb/>
here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are<lb/>
these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?</p>
<p>I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled<lb/>
woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the<lb/>
porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that<lb/>
looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scold-<lb/>
ing with a man in a purple woollen shirt.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Get along with ye,&#x201D; said she to the man, &#x201C;or I&#x0027;ll be comb-<lb/>
ing ye!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come on, Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;all right. There&#x0027;s Mrs.<lb/>
Hussey.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home,<lb/>
but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his<lb/>
affairs. Upon making known our desires for a supper and a<lb/>
bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the present,<lb/>
ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread<lb/>
with the relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us<lb/>
and said&#x2014;&#x201C;Clam or Cod?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n110" n="73"/>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s that about Cods, ma&#x0027;am?&#x201D; said I, with much politeness.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Clam or Cod?&#x201D; she repeated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A clam for supper? a cold clam; is <hi rend="i">that</hi> what you mean,<lb/>
Mrs. Hussey?&#x201D; says I; &#x201C;but that&#x0027;s a rather cold and clammy<lb/>
reception in the winter time, ain&#x0027;t it, Mrs. Hussey?&#x201D;</p>
<p>But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the<lb/>
purple shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming<lb/>
to hear nothing but the word &#x201C;clam,&#x201D; Mrs. Hussey hurried<lb/>
towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out<lb/>
&#x201C;clam for two,&#x201D; disappeared.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;do you think that we can make out a<lb/>
supper for us both on one clam?&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to<lb/>
belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when<lb/>
that smoking chowder came in, the mystery was delightfully<lb/>
explained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It was made of<lb/>
small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with<lb/>
pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into little flakes;<lb/>
the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with<lb/>
pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty<lb/>
voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favorite fishing<lb/>
food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we<lb/>
despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a<lb/>
moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey&#x0027;s clam and cod an-<lb/>
nouncement, I thought I would try a little experiment. Stepping<lb/>
to the kitchen door, I uttered the word &#x201C;cod&#x201D; with great em-<lb/>
phasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savory<lb/>
steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good<lb/>
time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.</p>
<p>We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the<lb/>
bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect<lb/>
on the head? What&#x0027;s that stultifying saying about chowder-<lb/>
eaded people? &#x201C;But look, Queequeg, ain&#x0027;t that a live eel in<lb/>
your bowl? Where&#x0027;s your harpoon?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n111" n="74"/>
<p>Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well<lb/>
deserved its name; for the pots there were always boiling<lb/>
chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and<lb/>
chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming<lb/>
through your clothes. The area before the house was paved<lb/>
with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of<lb/>
codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books<lb/>
bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to<lb/>
the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morn-<lb/>
ing happening to take a stroll along the beach among some<lb/>
fishermen&#x0027;s boats, I saw Hosea&#x0027;s brindled cow feeding on fish<lb/>
remnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod&#x0027;s<lb/>
decapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.</p>
<p>Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from<lb/>
Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as<lb/>
Queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs, the lady<lb/>
reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she allowed<lb/>
no harpoon in her chambers. &#x201C;Why not?&#x201D; said I; &#x201C;every<lb/>
true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon&#x2014;but why not?&#x201D;<lb/>
&#x201C;Because it&#x0027;s dangerous,&#x201D; says she. &#x201C;Ever since young Stiggs<lb/>
coming from that unfort&#x0027;nt v&#x0027;y&#x0027;ge of his, when he was gone<lb/>
four years and a half, with only three barrels of <hi rend="i">ile</hi>, was found<lb/>
dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever<lb/>
since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons<lb/>
in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg&#x201D; (for she had learned<lb/>
his name), &#x201C;I will just take this here iron, and keep it for you<lb/>
till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for<lb/>
breakfast, men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Both,&#x201D; says I; &#x201C;and let&#x0027;s have a couple of smoked herring<lb/>
by way of variety.&#x201D;</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the ship</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">In</hi> bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my<lb/>
surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to under-<lb/>
stand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo&#x2014;the name<lb/>
of his black little god&#x2014;and Yojo had told him two or three<lb/>
times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead<lb/>
of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and<lb/>
in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo<lb/>
earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest<lb/>
wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us;<lb/>
and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel,<lb/>
which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon,<lb/>
for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and<lb/>
in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present<lb/>
irrespective of Queequeg.</p>
<p>I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg<lb/>
placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo&#x0027;s judgment<lb/>
and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with consi-<lb/>
derable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant<lb/>
well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in<lb/>
his benevolent designs.</p>
<p>Now, this plan of Queequeg&#x0027;s, or rather Yojo&#x0027;s, touching the se-<lb/>
lection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a<lb/>
little relied upon Queequeg&#x0027;s sagacity to point out the whaler<lb/>
best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my<lb/>
remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged<lb/>
to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business<lb/>
with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n113" n="76"/>
quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early,<lb/>
leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom&#x2014;for<lb/>
it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of<lb/>
fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that<lb/>
day; <hi rend="i">how</hi> it was I never could find out, for, though I applied<lb/>
myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and<lb/>
XXXIX Articles&#x2014;leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his<lb/>
tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire<lb/>
of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much<lb/>
prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that<lb/>
there were three ships up for three-years&#x0027; voyages&#x2014;The Devil-<lb/>
dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. <hi rend="i">Devil-Dam</hi>, I do not know<lb/>
the origin of; <hi rend="i">Tit-bit</hi> is obvious; <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>, you will no doubt<lb/>
remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts<lb/>
Indians, now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed<lb/>
about the Devil-Dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and,<lb/>
finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a<lb/>
moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.</p>
<p>You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for<lb/>
aught I know;&#x2014;square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese<lb/>
junks; butter-box galliots, and what not; but take my word for<lb/>
it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old<lb/>
Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if any-<lb/>
thing; with an old fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long<lb/>
seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all<lb/>
four oceans, her old hull&#x0027;s complexion was darkened like a French<lb/>
grenadier&#x0027;s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her vene<lb/>
able bows looked bearded. Her masts&#x2014;cut somewhere on the<lb/>
coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in<lb/>
a gale&#x2014;her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the<lb/>
three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and<lb/>
wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury<lb/>
Cathedral where Beckett bled. But to all these her old anti-<lb/>
quities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n114" n="77"/>
the wild business that for more than half a century she had<lb/>
followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before<lb/>
he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired<lb/>
seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,&#x2014;this<lb/>
old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built<lb/>
upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a<lb/>
quaintness both of material and device, unmatched by anything<lb/>
except it be Thorkill-Hake&#x0027;s carved buckler or bedstead. She<lb/>
was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck<lb/>
heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of<lb/>
trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the<lb/>
chased bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open<lb/>
bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long<lb/>
sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to<lb/>
fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran<lb/>
not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled<lb/>
over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her<lb/>
reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in<lb/>
one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of<lb/>
her hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller<lb/>
in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery<lb/>
steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most<lb/>
melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.</p>
<p>Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one<lb/>
having authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for<lb/>
the voyage, at first I saw nobody; but I could not well over-<lb/>
look a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little<lb/>
behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection<lb/>
used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high;<lb/>
consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken<lb/>
from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-<lb/>
whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of<lb/>
these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other,<lb/>
and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n115" n="78"/>
fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowot-<lb/>
tamie Sachem&#x0027;s head. A triangular opening faced towards the<lb/>
bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete<lb/>
view forward.</p>
<p>And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found<lb/>
one who by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it<lb/>
being noon, and the ship&#x0027;s work suspended, was now enjoying<lb/>
respite from the burden of command. He was seated on<lb/>
an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious<lb/>
carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout<lb/>
interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was<lb/>
constructed.</p>
<p>There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the<lb/>
appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and<lb/>
brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue<lb/>
pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and<lb/>
almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing<lb/>
round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sail-<lb/>
ings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;&#x2014;<lb/>
for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed<lb/>
together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is this the Captain of the Pequod?&#x201D; said I, advancing to<lb/>
the door of the tent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Supposing it be the Captain of the Pequod, what dost thou<lb/>
want of him?&#x201D; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was thinking of shipping.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer&#x2014;<lb/>
ever been in a stove boat?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, Sir, I never have.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say&#x2014;eh?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.<lb/>
I&#x0027;ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think<lb/>
that&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n116" n="79"/>
Dost see that leg?&#x2014;I&#x0027;ll take that leg away from thy stern, if<lb/>
ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again. Mar-<lb/>
chant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable<lb/>
proud of having served in those marchant ships. But flukes!<lb/>
man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?&#x2014;it looks a<lb/>
little suspicious, don&#x0027;t it, eh?&#x2014;Hast not been a pirate, hast<lb/>
thou?&#x2014;Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?&#x2014;Dost not<lb/>
think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under<lb/>
the mask of these half humorous inuendoes, this old seaman,<lb/>
as an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular<lb/>
prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed<lb/>
from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before<lb/>
I think of shipping ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the<lb/>
world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye<lb/>
on Captain Ahab?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who is Captain Ahab, sir?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of<lb/>
this ship.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the<lb/>
Captain himself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg&#x2014;that&#x0027;s who ye are<lb/>
speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad<lb/>
to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with<lb/>
all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents.<lb/>
But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whal-<lb/>
ing is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it<lb/>
out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye<lb/>
on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has<lb/>
only one leg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n117" n="80"/>
<p>&#x201C;Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was<lb/>
devoured, chewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty<lb/>
that ever chipped a boat!&#x2014;ah, ah!&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little<lb/>
touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but<lb/>
said as calmly as I could, &#x201C;What you say is no doubt true<lb/>
enough, sir; but how could I know there was any peculiar<lb/>
ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have<lb/>
inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d&#x0027;ye<lb/>
see; thou dost not talk shark a bit. <hi rend="i">Sure</hi>, ye&#x0027;ve been to sea<lb/>
before now; sure of that?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;I thought I told you that I had been four<lb/>
voyages in the merchant&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the mar-<lb/>
chant service&#x2014;don&#x0027;t aggravate me&#x2014;I won&#x0027;t have it. But let<lb/>
us understand each other. I have given thee a hint about what<lb/>
whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I do, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon<lb/>
down a live whale&#x0027;s throat, and then jump after it? Answer,<lb/>
quick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so;<lb/>
not to be got rid of, that is; which I don&#x0027;t take to be the fact.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-<lb/>
whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also<lb/>
want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye<lb/>
said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and<lb/>
take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and<lb/>
tell me what ye see there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request,<lb/>
not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in<lb/>
earnest. But concentrating all his crow&#x0027;s feet into one scowl,<lb/>
Captain Peleg started me on the errand.</p>
<pb xml:id="n118" n="81"/>
<p>Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I per-<lb/>
ceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide,<lb/>
was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean. The<lb/>
prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and for-<lb/>
bidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, what&#x0027;s the report?&#x201D; said Peleg when I came back;<lb/>
&#x201C;what did ye see?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not much,&#x201D; I replied&#x2014;&#x201C;nothing but water; considerable<lb/>
horizon though, and there&#x0027;s a squall coming up, I think.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world? Do<lb/>
ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?<lb/>
Can&#x0027;t ye see the world where you stand?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I<lb/>
would; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any&#x2014;I thought<lb/>
the best&#x2014;and all this I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so<lb/>
determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,&#x201D; he<lb/>
added&#x2014;&#x201C;come along with ye.&#x201D; And so saying, he led the way<lb/>
below deck into the cabin.</p>
<p>Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most<lb/>
uncommon and surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain<lb/>
Bildad, who along with Captain Peleg was one of the largest<lb/>
owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case<lb/>
in these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants;<lb/>
widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each owning<lb/>
about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail<lb/>
or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in<lb/>
whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved<lb/>
state stocks bringing in good interest.</p>
<p>Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucket-<lb/>
ers, was a Quaker, the island having been originally settled by<lb/>
that sect; and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in<lb/>
an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the Quaker, only<lb/>
variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n119" n="82"/>
and heterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the<lb/>
most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They are<lb/>
fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.</p>
<p>So that there are instances among them of men, who, named<lb/>
with Scripture names&#x2014;a singularly common fashion on the<lb/>
island&#x2014;and in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic<lb/>
thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious,<lb/>
daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives,<lb/>
strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand<lb/>
bold dashes of character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king,<lb/>
or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things unite in a<lb/>
man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain<lb/>
and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclu-<lb/>
sion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and<lb/>
beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to<lb/>
think untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature&#x0027;s<lb/>
sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary<lb/>
and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help<lb/>
from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty<lb/>
language&#x2014;that man makes one in a whole nation&#x0027;s census&#x2014;a<lb/>
mighty pageant creature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will<lb/>
it at all detract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by<lb/>
birth or other circumstances, he have what seems a half wilful<lb/>
over-ruling, morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all<lb/>
men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness.<lb/>
Be sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but<lb/>
disease. But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but<lb/>
with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it<lb/>
only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified<lb/>
by individual circumstances.</p>
<p>Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired<lb/>
whaleman. But unlike Captain Peleg&#x2014;who cared not a rush<lb/>
for what are called serious things, and indeed deemed those<lb/>
self-same serious things the veriest of all trifles&#x2014;Captain Bildad<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n120" n="83"/>
had not only been originally educated according to the strictest<lb/>
sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life,<lb/>
and the sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the<lb/>
Horn&#x2014;all that had not moved this native born Quaker one<lb/>
single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his vest.<lb/>
Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common<lb/>
consistency about worthy Captain Peleg. Though refusing, from<lb/>
conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet<lb/>
himself had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and<lb/>
though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-<lb/>
bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How<lb/>
now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious Bildad<lb/>
reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but<lb/>
it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he had<lb/>
long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man&#x0027;s<lb/>
religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.<lb/>
This world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in<lb/>
short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad<lb/>
shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-<lb/>
mate, and captain, and finally a ship-owner; Bildad, as I<lb/>
hinted before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly<lb/>
retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicat-<lb/>
ing his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned<lb/>
income.</p>
<p>Now Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being<lb/>
an incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter,<lb/>
hard task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it cer-<lb/>
tainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut<lb/>
whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried<lb/>
ashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For<lb/>
a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather<lb/>
hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear, though,<lb/>
at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate quan-<lb/>
tity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n121" n="84"/>
Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye intently<lb/>
looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could<lb/>
clutch something&#x2014;a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to<lb/>
work like mad, at something or other, never mind what. Indo-<lb/>
lence and idleness perished from before him. His own person<lb/>
was the exaact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his<lb/>
long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous<lb/>
beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn<lb/>
nap of his broad-brimmed hat.</p>
<p>Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom<lb/>
when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space<lb/>
between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old<lb/>
Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his<lb/>
coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs<lb/>
were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to<lb/>
his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in read-<lb/>
ing from a ponderous volume.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bildad,&#x201D; cried Captain Peleg, &#x201C;at it again, Bildad, eh?<lb/>
Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty<lb/>
years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?&#x201D;</p>
<p>As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,<lb/>
Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked<lb/>
up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He says he&#x0027;s our man, Bildad,&#x201D; said Peleg, &#x201C;he wants<lb/>
to ship.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Dost thee?&#x201D; said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning<lb/>
round to me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I <hi rend="i">dost</hi>,&#x201D; said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do ye think of him, Bildad?&#x201D; said Peleg.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;ll do,&#x201D; said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spell-<lb/>
ing away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.</p>
<p>I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, espe-<lb/>
cially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blus-<lb/>
terer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n122" n="85"/>
Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a<lb/>
little table. I began to think it was high time to settle with<lb/>
myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the voy-<lb/>
age. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid<lb/>
no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain<lb/>
shares of the profits called <hi rend="i">lays</hi>, and that these lays were pro-<lb/>
portioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respec-<lb/>
tive duties of the ship&#x0027;s company. I was also aware that being<lb/>
a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large;<lb/>
but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship,<lb/>
splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had<lb/>
heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay&#x2014;that is, the<lb/>
275th part of the clear nett proceeds of the voyage, whatever<lb/>
that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay<lb/>
was what they call a rather <hi rend="i">long lay</hi>, yet it was better than<lb/>
nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly<lb/>
pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my<lb/>
three years&#x0027; beef and board, for which I would not have to pay<lb/>
one stiver.</p>
<p>It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate<lb/>
a princely fortune&#x2014;and so it was, a very poor way indeed.<lb/>
But I am one of those that never take on about princely for-<lb/>
tunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to board and<lb/>
lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the<lb/>
Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th<lb/>
lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been<lb/>
surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a<lb/>
broad-shouldered make.</p>
<p>But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful<lb/>
about receiving a generous share of the profits was this:<lb/>
Ashore, I had heard something of both Captain Peleg and his<lb/>
unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the principal<lb/>
proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more inconsi-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n123" n="86"/>
derable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management<lb/>
of the ship&#x0027;s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what<lb/>
the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about<lb/>
shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the<lb/>
Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible<lb/>
as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying<lb/>
to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small<lb/>
surprise, considering that he was such an interested party in<lb/>
these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on<lb/>
mumbling to himself out of his book, &#x201C;<hi rend="i">Lay not</hi> up for<lb/>
yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, Captain Bildad,&#x201D; interrupted Peleg, &#x201C;what d&#x0027;ye say,<lb/>
what lay shall we give this young man?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou knowest best,&#x201D; was the sepulchral reply, &#x201C;the seven<lb/>
hundred and seventy-seventh wouldn&#x0027;t be too much, would it?&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x2018;where moth and rust do corrupt, <hi rend="i">but lay</hi>&#x2014;&#x201D;&#x2019;</p>
<p><hi rend="i">Lay</hi>, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred<lb/>
and seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined<lb/>
that I, for one, shall not <hi rend="i">lay</hi> up many <hi rend="i">lays</hi> here below, where<lb/>
moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly <hi rend="i">long lay</hi><lb/>
that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it<lb/>
might at first deceive a landsman, yet the slightest considera-<lb/>
tion will show that though seven hundred and seventy-seven is a<lb/>
pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a <hi rend="i">teenth</hi> of<lb/>
it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and seventy-<lb/>
seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven<lb/>
hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at<lb/>
the time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,&#x201D; cried Peleg, &#x201C;thou dost not<lb/>
want to swindle this young man! he must have more than<lb/>
that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,&#x201D; again said Bildad,<lb/>
without lifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling&#x2014;&#x201C;for<lb/>
where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n124" n="87"/>
<p>&#x201C;I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,&#x201D;<lb/>
said Peleg, &#x201C;do ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth<lb/>
lay, I say.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him<lb/>
said, &#x201C;Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou<lb/>
must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this<lb/>
ship&#x2014;widows and orphans, many of them&#x2014;and that if we too<lb/>
abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be<lb/>
taking the bread from those widows and those orphans. The<lb/>
seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou Bildad!&#x201D; roared Peleg, starting up and clattering<lb/>
about the cabin. &#x201C;Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed<lb/>
thy advice in these matters, I would afore now had a conscience<lb/>
to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest<lb/>
ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Peleg,&#x201D; said Bildad steadily, &#x201C;thy conscience may<lb/>
be drawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can&#x0027;t tell;<lb/>
but as thou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly<lb/>
fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the<lb/>
end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural<lb/>
bearing, ye insult me. It&#x0027;s an all-fired outrage to tell any<lb/>
human creature that he&#x0027;s bound to hell. Flukes and flames!<lb/>
Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soul-bolts, but<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll&#x2014;I&#x0027;ll&#x2014;yes, I&#x0027;ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and<lb/>
horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-colored son of a<lb/>
wooden gun&#x2014;a straight wake with ye!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with<lb/>
a marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time<lb/>
eluded him.</p>
<p>Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal<lb/>
and responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to<lb/>
give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and<lb/>
temporarily commanded. I stepped aside from the door to give<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n125" n="88"/>
egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to<lb/>
vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my<lb/>
astonishment, he sat down again on the transom very quietly,<lb/>
and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing.<lb/>
He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As<lb/>
for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no<lb/>
more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he<lb/>
twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. &#x201C;Whew!&#x201D; he<lb/>
whistled at last&#x2014;&#x201C;the squall&#x0027;s gone off to leeward, I think.<lb/>
Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that<lb/>
pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That&#x0027;s<lb/>
he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael&#x0027;s<lb/>
thy name, didn&#x0027;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here,<lb/>
Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Peleg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;I have a friend with me who<lb/>
wants to ship too&#x2014;shall I bring him down to-morrow?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;To be sure,&#x201D; said Peleg. &#x201C;Fetch him along, and we&#x0027;ll<lb/>
look at him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What lay does he want?&#x201D; groaned Bildad, glancing up<lb/>
from the book in which he had again been burying himself.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,&#x201D; said Peleg.<lb/>
&#x201C;Has he ever whaled it any?&#x201D; turning to me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, bring him along then.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting<lb/>
but that I had done a good morning&#x0027;s work, and that the<lb/>
Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry<lb/>
Queequeg and me round the Cape.</p>
<p>But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me<lb/>
that the captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen<lb/>
by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be<lb/>
completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere the<lb/>
captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for<lb/>
sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore inter-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n126" n="89"/>
vals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have a<lb/>
family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not<lb/>
trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her<lb/>
to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as<lb/>
well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing your-<lb/>
self into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,<lb/>
inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It&#x0027;s all right<lb/>
enough; thou art shipped.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes, but I should like to see him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But I don&#x0027;t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don&#x0027;t<lb/>
know exactly what&#x0027;s the matter with him; but he keeps close<lb/>
inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don&#x0027;t look so. In<lb/>
fact, he ain&#x0027;t sick; but no, he isn&#x0027;t well either. Any how,<lb/>
young man, he won&#x0027;t always see me, so I don&#x0027;t suppose he will<lb/>
thee. He&#x0027;s a queer man, Captain Ahab&#x2014;so some think&#x2014;but<lb/>
a good one. Oh, thou&#x0027;lt like him well enough; no fear, no<lb/>
fear. He&#x0027;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;<lb/>
doesn&#x0027;t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may<lb/>
well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab&#x0027;s above the com-<lb/>
mon; Ahab&#x0027;s been in colleges, as well as &#x0027;mong the cannibals;<lb/>
been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery<lb/>
lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye,<lb/>
the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he<lb/>
ain&#x0027;t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain&#x0027;t Captain Peleg; <hi rend="i">he&#x0027;s<lb/>
Ahab</hi>, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned<lb/>
king!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain,<lb/>
the dogs, did they not lick his blood?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come hither to me&#x2014;hither, hither,&#x201D; said Peleg, with a<lb/>
significance in his eye that almost startled me. &#x201C;Look ye, lad;<lb/>
never say that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere.<lb/>
Captain Ahab did not name himself. &#x0027;Twas a foolish, ignorant<lb/>
whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n127" n="90"/>
a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gay-<lb/>
head, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic.<lb/>
And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I<lb/>
wish to warn thee. It&#x0027;s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well;<lb/>
I&#x0027;ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is&#x2014;<lb/>
a good man&#x2014;not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a<lb/>
swearing good man&#x2014;something like me&#x2014;only there&#x0027;s a good<lb/>
deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very<lb/>
jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a little<lb/>
out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains<lb/>
in his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one<lb/>
might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last<lb/>
voyage by that accursed whale, he&#x0027;s been a kind of moody&#x2014;<lb/>
desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass<lb/>
off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young<lb/>
man, it&#x0027;s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laugh-<lb/>
ing bad one. So good-bye to thee&#x2014;and wrong not Captain<lb/>
Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides,<lb/>
my boy, he has a wife&#x2014;not three voyages wedded&#x2014;a sweet,<lb/>
resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man<lb/>
has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless<lb/>
harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be,<lb/>
Ahab has his humanities!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had<lb/>
been incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me<lb/>
with a certain wild vagueness of painfulncess concerning him.<lb/>
And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for<lb/>
him, but for I don&#x0027;t know what, unless it was the cruel loss of<lb/>
his leg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that<lb/>
sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe;<lb/>
I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did not disin-<lb/>
eline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed<lb/>
like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.<lb/>
However, my thoughts were at length carried in other direc-<lb/>
tions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the ramadan</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">As</hi> Queequeg&#x0027;s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to<lb/>
continue all day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards<lb/>
night-fall; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody&#x0027;s<lb/>
religious obligations, never mind how comical, and could not<lb/>
find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of<lb/>
ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in<lb/>
certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of footmanism<lb/>
quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the<lb/>
torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account<lb/>
of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.</p>
<p>I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable<lb/>
in these things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to<lb/>
other mortals, pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy<lb/>
conceits on these subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly<lb/>
entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Rama-<lb/>
dan;&#x2014;but what of that? Queequeg thought he knew what<lb/>
he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content; and there<lb/>
let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let<lb/>
him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all&#x2014;Presbyte-<lb/>
rians and Pagans alike&#x2014;for we are all somehow dreadfully<lb/>
cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.</p>
<p>Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his perform-<lb/>
ances and rituals must be over, I went up to his room and<lb/>
knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried to open it, but it<lb/>
was fastened inside. &#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I softly through the<lb/>
key-hole:&#x2014;all silent. &#x201C;I say, Queequeg! why don&#x0027;t you<lb/>
speak? It&#x0027;s I&#x2014;Ishmael.&#x201D; But all remained still as before. I<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n129" n="92"/>
began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant<lb/>
time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked<lb/>
through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner<lb/>
of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister<lb/>
one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a<lb/>
line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold<lb/>
resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg&#x0027;s harpoon,<lb/>
which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, be-<lb/>
fore our mounting to the chamber. That&#x0027;s strange, thought I;<lb/>
but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom<lb/>
or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here,<lb/>
and no possible mistake.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg!&#x2014;Queequeg!&#x201D;&#x2014;all still. Something must<lb/>
have happened. Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door;<lb/>
but it stubbornly resisted. Running down stairs, I quickly<lb/>
stated my suspicions to the first person I met&#x2014;the chamber-<lb/>
maid. &#x201C;La! La!&#x201D; she cried, &#x201C;I thought something must be the<lb/>
matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door<lb/>
was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it&#x0027;s been just<lb/>
so silent ever since. But I thought, may be, you had both<lb/>
gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping. La!<lb/>
La, ma&#x0027;am!&#x2014;Mistress! murder! Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!&#x201D;&#x2014;<lb/>
and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand<lb/>
and a vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from<lb/>
the occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her<lb/>
little black boy meantime.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wood-house!&#x201D; cried I, &#x201C;which way to it? Run for God&#x0027;s<lb/>
sake, and fetch something to pry open the door&#x2014;the axe!&#x2014;<lb/>
the axe!&#x2014;he&#x0027;s had a stroke; depend upon it!&#x201D;&#x2014;and so saying<lb/>
I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed,<lb/>
when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-<lb/>
cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s the matter with you, young man?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n130" n="93"/>
<p>&#x201C;Get the axe! For God&#x0027;s sake, run for the doctor, some<lb/>
one, while I pry it open!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look here,&#x201D; said the landlady, quickly putting down the<lb/>
vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; &#x201C;look here; are<lb/>
you talking about prying open any of my doors?&#x201D;&#x2014;and with<lb/>
that she seized my arm. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s the matter with you?<lb/>
What&#x0027;s the matter with you, shipmate?&#x201D;</p>
<p>In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to un-<lb/>
derstand the whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-<lb/>
cruet to one side of her nose, she ruminated for an instant;<lb/>
then exclaimed&#x2014;&#x201C;No! I haven&#x0027;t seen it since I put it there.&#x201D;<lb/>
Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs,<lb/>
she glanced in, and returning, told me that Queequeg&#x0027;s harpoon<lb/>
was missing. &#x201C;He&#x0027;s killed himself,&#x201D; she cried. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s unfort&#x0027;-<lb/>
nate Stiggs done over again&#x2014;there goes another counterpane&#x2014;<lb/>
God pity his poor mother!&#x2014;it will be the ruin of my house.<lb/>
Has the poor lad a sister? Where&#x0027;s that girl?&#x2014;there, Betty, go<lb/>
to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x2018;no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;&#x2019;&#x2014;<lb/>
might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be merciful<lb/>
to his ghost! What&#x0027;s that noise there? You, young man,<lb/>
avast there!&#x201D;</p>
<p>And running up after me, she caught me as I was again<lb/>
trying to force open the door.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I won&#x0027;t allow it; I won&#x0027;t have my premises spoiled. Go<lb/>
for the locksmith, there&#x0027;s one about a mile from here. But<lb/>
avast!&#x201D; putting her hand in her side-pocket, &#x201C;here&#x0027;s a key<lb/>
that&#x0027;ll fit, I guess; let&#x0027;s see.&#x201D; And with that, she turned it in the<lb/>
lock; but, alas! Queequeg&#x0027;s supplemental bolt remained unwith-<lb/>
drawn within.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Have to burst it open,&#x201D; said I, and was running down the<lb/>
entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me,<lb/>
again vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore<lb/>
from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full<lb/>
against the mark.</p>
<pb xml:id="n131" n="94"/>
<p>With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knot<lb/>
slamming against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling;<lb/>
and there, good heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool<lb/>
and self-collected; right in the middle of the room; squatting<lb/>
on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He<lb/>
looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat like a carved<lb/>
image with scarce a sign of active life.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, going up to him, &#x201C;Queequeg, what&#x0027;s the<lb/>
matter with you?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He hain&#x0027;t been a sittin&#x0027; so all day, has he?&#x201D; said the<lb/>
landlady.</p>
<p>But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I<lb/>
almost felt like pushing him over, so as to change his position,<lb/>
for it was almost intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unna-<lb/>
turally constrained; especially, as in all probability he had<lb/>
been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too<lb/>
without his regular meals.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mrs. Hussey,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;he&#x0027;s <hi rend="i">alive</hi> at all events; so leave us,<lb/>
if you please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail<lb/>
upon Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat;<lb/>
and all he could do&#x2014;for all my polite arts and blandishments&#x2014;he<lb/>
would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor even look at<lb/>
me, nor notice my presence in any the slightest way.</p>
<p>I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his<lb/>
Ramadan; do they fast on their hams that way in his native<lb/>
island. It must be so; yes, it&#x0027;s part of his creed, I suppose;<lb/>
well, then, let him rest; he&#x0027;ll get up sooner or later, no doubt.<lb/>
It can&#x0027;t last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes<lb/>
once a year; and I don&#x0027;t believe it&#x0027;s very punctual then.</p>
<p>I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to<lb/>
the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a<lb/>
plum-pudding voyage, as they called it (that is, a short whaling-<lb/>
voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north of the line,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n132" n="95"/>
in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these plum-<lb/>
puddingers till nearly eleven o&#x0027;clock, I went up stairs to go to<lb/>
bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly<lb/>
have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there<lb/>
he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch.<lb/>
I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright<lb/>
senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night<lb/>
on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his<lb/>
head.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For heaven&#x0027;s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself;<lb/>
get up and have some supper. You&#x0027;ll starve; you&#x0027;ll kill your-<lb/>
self, Queequeg.&#x201D; But not a word did he reply.</p>
<p>Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and<lb/>
to sleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow<lb/>
me. But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin<lb/>
jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very cold<lb/>
night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on.<lb/>
For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest<lb/>
doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of<lb/>
Queequeg&#x2014;not four feet off&#x2014;sitting there in that uneasy posi-<lb/>
tion, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really<lb/>
wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with<lb/>
a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccounta-<lb/>
ble Ramadan!</p>
<p>But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more<lb/>
till break of day; when, looking over the bedside, there<lb/>
squatted Queequeg, as if he had been screwed down to the<lb/>
floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the<lb/>
window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a<lb/>
cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his<lb/>
forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was<lb/>
over.</p>
<p>Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person&#x0027;s<lb/>
religion, be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n133" n="96"/>
or insult any other person, because that other person don&#x0027;t<lb/>
believe it also. But when a man&#x0027;s religion becomes really<lb/>
frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine,<lb/>
makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then<lb/>
I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the<lb/>
point with him.</p>
<p>And just so I now did with Queequeg. &#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said<lb/>
I, &#x201C;get into bed now, and lie and listen to me.&#x201D; I then went<lb/>
on, beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive reli-<lb/>
gions, and coming down to the various religions of the present<lb/>
time, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all<lb/>
these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold,<lb/>
cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless<lb/>
for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene<lb/>
and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other<lb/>
things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it<lb/>
pained me, very badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably<lb/>
foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued<lb/>
I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves in;<lb/>
and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be half-starved.<lb/>
This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish<lb/>
such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word,<lb/>
Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born<lb/>
on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated<lb/>
through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.</p>
<p>I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled<lb/>
with dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he<lb/>
could take it in. He said no; only upon one memorable occa-<lb/>
sion. It was after a great feast given by his father the king,<lb/>
on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had<lb/>
been killed by about two o&#x0027;clock in the afternoon, and all<lb/>
cooked and eaten that very evening.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No more, Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, shuddering; &#x201C;that will do;&#x201D;<lb/>
for I knew the inferences without his further hinting them. I<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n134" n="97"/>
had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he told<lb/>
me that it was the custom, when a great battle had been gained<lb/>
there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the<lb/>
victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden<lb/>
trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit<lb/>
and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were<lb/>
sent round with the victor&#x0027;s compliments to all his friends, just<lb/>
as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.</p>
<p>After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion<lb/>
made much impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first<lb/>
place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important<lb/>
subject, unless considered from his own point of view; and, in<lb/>
the second place, he did not more than one third understand<lb/>
me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no<lb/>
doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true<lb/>
religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of conde-<lb/>
scending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a<lb/>
great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hope-<lb/>
lessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.</p>
<p>At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodi-<lb/>
giously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the<lb/>
landlady should not make much profit by reason of his Rama-<lb/>
dan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and<lb/>
picking our teeth with halibut bones.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d18" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XVIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">his mark</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">As</hi> we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the<lb/>
ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his<lb/>
gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n135" n="98"/>
not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore<lb/>
announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless<lb/>
they previously produced their papers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?&#x201D; said I, now<lb/>
jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on<lb/>
the wharf.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I mean,&#x201D; he replied, &#x201C;he must show his papers.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yea,&#x201D; said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his<lb/>
head from behind Peleg&#x0027;s, out of the wigwam. &#x201C;He must show<lb/>
that he&#x0027;s converted. Son of darkness,&#x201D; he added, turning to<lb/>
Queequeg, &#x201C;art thou at present in communion with any<lb/>
christian church?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;he&#x0027;s a member of the first Congregational<lb/>
Church.&#x201D; Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing<lb/>
in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the<lb/>
churches.</p>
<p>&#x201C;First Congregational Church,&#x201D; cried Bildad, &#x201C;what! that<lb/>
worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman&#x0027;s meeting-house?&#x201D;<lb/>
and so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with<lb/>
his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on<lb/>
very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly<lb/>
over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How long hath he been a member?&#x201D; he then said, turning<lb/>
to me; &#x201C;not very long, I rather guess, young man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No,&#x201D; said Peleg, &#x201C;and he hasn&#x0027;t been baptized right either,<lb/>
or it would have washed some of that devil&#x0027;s blue off his face.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do tell, now,&#x201D; cried Bildad, &#x201C;is this Philistine a regular<lb/>
member of Deacon Deuteronomy&#x0027;s meeting? I never saw him<lb/>
going there, and I pass it every Lord&#x0027;s day.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his<lb/>
meeting,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born<lb/>
member of the First Congregational Church. He is a deacon<lb/>
himself, Queequeg is.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Young man,&#x201D; said Bildad sternly, &#x201C;thou art skylarking<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n136" n="99"/>
with me&#x2014;explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church<lb/>
dost thee mean? answer me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. &#x201C;I mean, sir,<lb/>
the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and<lb/>
Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and<lb/>
every mother&#x0027;s son and soul of us belong; the great and ever-<lb/>
lasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world;<lb/>
we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer<lb/>
crotchets noways touching the grand belief; in <hi rend="i">that</hi> we all join<lb/>
hands.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Splice, thou mean&#x0027;st <hi rend="i">splice</hi> hands,&#x201D; cried Peleg, drawing<lb/>
nearer. &#x201C;Young man, you&#x0027;d better ship for a missionary,<lb/>
instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.<lb/>
Deacon Deuteronomy&#x2014;why Father Mapple himself couldn&#x0027;t<lb/>
beat it, and he&#x0027;s reckoned something. Come aboard, come<lb/>
aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog<lb/>
there&#x2014;what&#x0027;s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along.<lb/>
By the great anchor, what a harpoon he&#x0027;s got there! looks like<lb/>
good stuff that; and he handles it about right. I say,<lb/>
Quohog, or whatever your name is, did you ever stand in the<lb/>
head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a fish?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way,<lb/>
jumped upon the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of<lb/>
the whale-boats hanging to the side; and then bracing his left<lb/>
knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in some such way as<lb/>
this:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cap&#x0027;ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You<lb/>
see him? well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!&#x201D; and<lb/>
taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old<lb/>
Bildad&#x0027;s broad brim, clean across the ship&#x0027;s decks, and struck<lb/>
the glistening tar spot out of sight.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now,&#x201D; said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, &#x201C;spos-ee<lb/>
him whale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Quick, Bildad,&#x201D; said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n137" n="100"/>
close vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the<lb/>
cabin gangway. &#x201C;Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in<lb/>
one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we&#x0027;ll give ye the ninetieth<lb/>
lay, and that&#x0027;s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of<lb/>
Nantucket.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy<lb/>
Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship&#x0027;s company<lb/>
to which I myself belonged.</p>
<p>When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got every-<lb/>
thing ready for signing, he turned to me and said, &#x201C;I guess,<lb/>
Quohog there don&#x0027;t know how to write, does he? I say, Quohog,<lb/>
blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark?&#x201D;</p>
<p>But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice<lb/>
before taken part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed;<lb/>
but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the pro-<lb/>
per place, an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which<lb/>
was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg&#x0027;s<lb/>
obstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something<lb/>
like this:&#x2014;</p>
<p>Quohog.</p>
<p>his &#x2720; mark.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly<lb/>
eyeing Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in<lb/>
the huge pockets of his broad-skirted drab coat, took out a<lb/>
bundle of tracts, and selecting one entitled &#x201C;The Latter Day<lb/>
Coming; or No Time to Lose,&#x201D; placed it in Queequeg&#x0027;s hands,<lb/>
and then grasping them and the book with both his, looked<lb/>
earnestly into his eyes, and said, &#x201C;Son of darkness, I must do<lb/>
my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned<lb/>
for the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy<lb/>
Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not<lb/>
for aye a Belial bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n138" n="101"/>
hideous dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine<lb/>
eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of the fiery<lb/>
pit!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad&#x0027;s<lb/>
language, heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic<lb/>
phrases.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our<lb/>
harpooneer,&#x201D; cried Peleg. &#x201C;Pious harpooneers never make<lb/>
good voyagers&#x2014;it takes the shark out of &#x0027;em; no harpooneer<lb/>
is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young<lb/>
Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket<lb/>
and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never came to<lb/>
good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he<lb/>
shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps,<lb/>
in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Peleg! Peleg!&#x201D; said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands,<lb/>
&#x201C;thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time;<lb/>
thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how,<lb/>
then, can&#x0027;st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest<lb/>
thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same Pequod here<lb/>
had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on Japan, that<lb/>
same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did&#x0027;st<lb/>
thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hear him, hear him now,&#x201D; cried Peleg, marching across the<lb/>
cabin, and thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;hear him, all of ye. Think of that! When every moment we<lb/>
thought the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment<lb/>
then? What? With all three masts making such an ever-<lb/>
lasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking<lb/>
over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then?<lb/>
No! no time to think about Death then. Life was what<lb/>
Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save all<lb/>
hands&#x2014;how to rig jury-masts&#x2014;how to get into the nearest<lb/>
port; that was what I was thinking of.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n139" n="102"/>
<p>Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on<lb/>
deck, where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly<lb/>
overlooking some sail-makers who were mending a top-sail in<lb/>
the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch,<lb/>
or save an end of the tarred twine, which otherwise might have<lb/>
been wasted.</p>

<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="sc">Shipmates</hi>, have ye shipped in that ship?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were<lb/>
sauntering away from the water, for the moment each occupied<lb/>
with his own thoughts, when the above words were put to us<lb/>
by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his massive fore-<lb/>
finger at the vessel in question. He was but shabbily apparel-<lb/>
led in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a black<lb/>
handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had<lb/>
in all directions flowed over his face, and left it like the<lb/>
complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters<lb/>
have been dried up.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Have ye shipped in her?&#x201D; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,&#x201D; said I, trying to<lb/>
gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, the Pequod&#x2014;that ship there,&#x201D; he said, drawing back<lb/>
his whole arm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from<lb/>
him, with the fixed bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at<lb/>
the object.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;we have just signed the articles.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Anything down there about your souls?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;About what?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, perhaps you hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t got any,&#x201D; he said quickly. &#x201C;No<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n140" n="103"/>
matter though, I know many chaps that hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t got any,&#x2014;good<lb/>
luck to &#x0027;em; and they are all the better off for it. A soul&#x0027;s a<lb/>
sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What are you jabbering about, shipmate?&#x201D; said I.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="i">He&#x0027;s</hi> got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of<lb/>
that sort in other chaps,&#x201D; abruptly said the stranger, placing a<lb/>
nervous emphasis upon the word <hi rend="i">he.</hi></p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;let&#x0027;s go; this fellow has broken loose<lb/>
from somewhere; he&#x0027;s talking about something and somebody<lb/>
we don&#x0027;t know.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; cried the stranger. &#x201C;Ye said true&#x2014;ye hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t seen<lb/>
Old Thunder yet, have ye?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who&#x0027;s Old Thunder?&#x201D; said I, again riveted with the in-<lb/>
sane earnestness of his manner.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that<lb/>
name. Ye hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t seen him yet, have ye?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, we hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t. He&#x0027;s sick they say, but is getting better,<lb/>
and will be all right again before long.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All right again before long!&#x201D; laughed the stranger, with a<lb/>
solemnly derisive sort of laugh. &#x201C;Look ye; when captain<lb/>
Ahab is all right, then this left arm of mine will be all right;<lb/>
not before.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do you know about him?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What did they <hi rend="i">tell</hi> you about him? Say that!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They didn&#x0027;t tell much of anything about him; only I&#x0027;ve<lb/>
heard that he&#x0027;s a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his<lb/>
crew.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x0027;s true, that&#x0027;s true&#x2014;yes, both true enough. But you<lb/>
must jump when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl<lb/>
and go&#x2014;that&#x0027;s the word with Captain Ahab. But nothing<lb/>
about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long<lb/>
ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;<lb/>
nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n141" n="104"/>
the altar in Santa?&#x2014;heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing<lb/>
about the silver calabash he spat into? And nothing about his<lb/>
losing his leg last voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn&#x0027;t ye<lb/>
hear a word about them matters and something more, eh? No,<lb/>
I don&#x0027;t think ye did; how could ye? Who knows it? Not<lb/>
all Nantucket, I guess. But hows&#x0027;ever, mayhap, ye&#x0027;ve heard<lb/>
tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of<lb/>
that, I dare say. Oh yes, <hi rend="i">that</hi> every one knows a&#x0027;most&#x2014;I<lb/>
mean they know he&#x0027;s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took<lb/>
the other off.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;My friend,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;what all this gibberish of yours is about,<lb/>
I don&#x0027;t know, and I don&#x0027;t much care; for it seems to me that<lb/>
you must be a little damaged in the head. But if you are<lb/>
speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then<lb/>
let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of his leg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="i">All</hi> about it, eh&#x2014;sure you do?&#x2014;all?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pretty sure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the<lb/>
beggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie;<lb/>
then starting a little, turned and said:&#x2014;&#x201C;Ye&#x0027;ve shipped, have<lb/>
ye? Names down on the papers? Well, well, what&#x0027;s signed,<lb/>
is signed; and what&#x0027;s to be, will be; and then again, perhaps<lb/>
it wont be, after all. Any how, it&#x0027;s all fixed and arranged<lb/>
a&#x0027;ready; and some sailors or other must go with him, I<lb/>
suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity &#x0027;em!<lb/>
Morning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless<lb/>
ye; I&#x0027;m sorry I stopped ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look here, friend,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;if you have anything impor-<lb/>
tant to tell us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bam-<lb/>
boozle us, you are mistaken in your game; that&#x0027;s all I have to<lb/>
say.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And it&#x0027;s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up<lb/>
that way; you are just the man for him&#x2014;the likes of ye.<lb/>
Morning to ye, shipmates, morning! Oh! when ye get there,<lb/>
tell &#x0027;em I&#x0027;ve concluded not to make one of &#x0027;em.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n142" n="105"/>
<p>&#x201C;Ah, my dear fellow, you can&#x0027;t fool us that way&#x2014;you can&#x0027;t<lb/>
fool us. It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look<lb/>
as if he had a great secret in him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Morning it is,&#x201D; said I. &#x201C;Come along, Queequeg, let&#x0027;s<lb/>
leave this crazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Elijah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting,<lb/>
after each other&#x0027;s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor;<lb/>
and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug, trying to be a<lb/>
bugbear. But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred<lb/>
yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I<lb/>
did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us, though at a<lb/>
distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I said<lb/>
nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with<lb/>
my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn<lb/>
the same corner that we did. He did; and then it seemed<lb/>
to me that he was dogging us, but with what intent I could<lb/>
not for the life of me imagine. This circumstance, coupled with<lb/>
his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded sort of<lb/>
talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half-<lb/>
apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Cap-<lb/>
tain Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit;<lb/>
and the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of<lb/>
him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the prediction<lb/>
of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves<lb/>
to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.</p>
<p>I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah<lb/>
was really dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the<lb/>
way with Queequeg, and on that side of it retraced our steps.<lb/>
But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us. This<lb/>
relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I<lb/>
pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.</p>
</div1>

<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d20" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">all astir</hi>.</head>
<p>A <hi rend="sc">Day</hi> or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the<lb/>
Pequod. Not only were the old sails being mended, but new<lb/>
sails were coming on board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of<lb/>
rigging; in short, everything betokened that the ship&#x0027;s prepara-<lb/>
tions were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or never<lb/>
went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out<lb/>
upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at<lb/>
the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the rig-<lb/>
ging were working till long after nightfall.</p>
<p>On the day following Queequeg&#x0027;s signing the articles, word<lb/>
was given at all the inns where the ship&#x0027;s company were stop-<lb/>
ping, that their chests must be on board before night, for there<lb/>
was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing. So<lb/>
Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to<lb/>
sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very<lb/>
long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several<lb/>
days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and<lb/>
there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before<lb/>
the Pequod was fully equipped.</p>
<p>Every one knows what a multitude of things&#x2014;beds, sauce-<lb/>
pans, knives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers,<lb/>
and what not, are indispensable to the business of housekeep-<lb/>
ing. Just so with whaling, which necessitates a three-years&#x0027;<lb/>
housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers, coster-<lb/>
mongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also<lb/>
holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the<lb/>
same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length<lb/>
of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n144" n="107"/>
prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them<lb/>
at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered,<lb/>
that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed to acci-<lb/>
dents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss of<lb/>
the very things upon which the success of the voyage most<lb/>
depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare lines<lb/>
and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Cap-<lb/>
tain and duplicate ship.</p>
<p>At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest stor-<lb/>
age of the Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her<lb/>
beef, bread, water, fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before<lb/>
hinted, for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying<lb/>
on board of divers odds and ends of things, both large and small.</p>
<p>Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was<lb/>
Captain Bildad&#x0027;s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined<lb/>
and indefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed<lb/>
resolved that, if <hi rend="i">she</hi> could help it, nothing should be found want-<lb/>
ing in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time<lb/>
she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward&#x0027;s<lb/>
pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate&#x0027;s<lb/>
desk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel<lb/>
for the small of some one&#x0027;s rheumatic back. Never did any<lb/>
woman better deserve her name, which was Charity&#x2014;Aunt<lb/>
Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity<lb/>
did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither,<lb/>
ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to<lb/>
yield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in<lb/>
which her beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which<lb/>
she herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.</p>
<p>But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress<lb/>
coming on board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle<lb/>
in one hand, and a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor<lb/>
was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all backward. As for<lb/>
Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the articles<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n145" n="108"/>
needed, and at every fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite<lb/>
that article upon the paper. Every once and a while Peleg came<lb/>
hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men down<lb/>
the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and<lb/>
then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.</p>
<p>During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited<lb/>
the craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how<lb/>
he was, and when he was going to come on board his ship. To<lb/>
these questions they would answer, that he was getting better<lb/>
and better, and was expected aboard every day; meantime, the<lb/>
two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything<lb/>
necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been down-<lb/>
right honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart<lb/>
that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a<lb/>
voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be<lb/>
the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the<lb/>
open sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes<lb/>
happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensi-<lb/>
bly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself. And<lb/>
much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to<lb/>
think nothing.</p>
<p>At last it was given out that some time next day the ship<lb/>
would certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a<lb/>
very early start.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Yes, we are,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;but what business is that of yours?<lb/>
Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little imper-<lb/>
tinent?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, no, no; I wasn&#x0027;t aware of that,&#x201D; said Elijah, slowly<lb/>
and wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most<lb/>
unaccountable glances.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Elijah,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;you will oblige my friend and me by with-<lb/>
drawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and<lb/>
would prefer not to be detained.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;s cracked, Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;come on.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Holloa!&#x201D; cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had<lb/>
removed a few paces.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Never mind him,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;Queequeg, come on.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand<lb/>
on my shoulder, said&#x2014;&#x201D; Did ye see anything looking like men<lb/>
going towards that ship a while ago?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, say-<lb/>
ing &#x201C;Yes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was<lb/>
too dim to be sure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Very dim, very dim,&#x201D; said Elijah. &#x201C;Morning to ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly<lb/>
after us; and touching my shoulder again, said, &#x201C;See if you<lb/>
can find &#x0027;em now, will ye?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n147" n="110"/>
<p>&#x201C;Find who?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Morning to ye! morning to ye!&#x201D; he rejoined, again<lb/>
moving off. &#x201C;Oh! I was going to warn ye against&#x2014;but never<lb/>
mind, never mind&#x2014;it&#x0027;s all one, all in the family too;&#x2014;sharp<lb/>
frost this morning, ain&#x0027;t it? Good bye to ye. Shan&#x0027;t see ye<lb/>
again very soon, I guess; unless it&#x0027;s before the Grand Jury.&#x201D;<lb/>
And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving me,<lb/>
for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impu-<lb/>
dence.</p>
<p>At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything<lb/>
in profound quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was<lb/>
locked within; the hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils<lb/>
of rigging. Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide<lb/>
of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down, and found<lb/>
only an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket.<lb/>
He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face down-<lb/>
wards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slum-<lb/>
ber slept upon him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone<lb/>
to?&#x201D; said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed<lb/>
that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what<lb/>
I now alluded to; hence I would have thought myself to have<lb/>
been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah&#x0027;s<lb/>
otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down;<lb/>
and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg<lb/>
that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to<lb/>
establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the<lb/>
sleeper&#x0027;s rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and<lb/>
then, without more ado, sat quietly down there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gracious! Queequeg, don&#x0027;t sit there,&#x201D; said I.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! perry dood seat,&#x201D; said Queequeg, &#x201C;my country way;<lb/>
won&#x0027;t hurt him face.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Face!&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;call that his face? very benevolent coun-<lb/>
tenance then; but how hard he breathes, he&#x0027;s heaving himself;<lb/>
get off, Queequeg, you are heavy, it&#x0027;s grinding the face<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n148" n="111"/>
of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look, he&#x0027;ll twitch you<lb/>
off soon. I wonder he don&#x0027;t wake.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the<lb/>
sleeper, and lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet.<lb/>
We kept the pipe passing over the sleeper, from one to the<lb/>
other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken fashion,<lb/>
Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land, owing<lb/>
to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,<lb/>
chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fatten-<lb/>
ing some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish<lb/>
a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up<lb/>
eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and<lb/>
alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on an excursion;<lb/>
much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible<lb/>
into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attend-<lb/>
ant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a<lb/>
spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.</p>
<p>While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received<lb/>
the tomahawk from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it<lb/>
over the sleeper&#x0027;s head.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s that for, Queequeg?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!&#x201D;</p>
<p>He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his<lb/>
tomahawk-pipe, which, it seemed, had in its two uses both<lb/>
brained his foes and soothed his soul, when we were directly<lb/>
attracted to the sleeping rigger. The strong vapor now com-<lb/>
pletely filling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him.<lb/>
He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed troubled<lb/>
in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and<lb/>
rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Holloa!&#x201D; he breathed at last, &#x201C;who be ye smokers?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Shipped men,&#x201D; answered I, &#x201C;when does she sail?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day.<lb/>
The Captain came aboard last night.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n149" n="112"/>
<p>&#x201C;What Captain?&#x2014;Ahab?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who but him indeed?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was going to ask him some further questions concerning<lb/>
Ahab, when we heard a noise on deck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Holloa! Starbuck&#x0027;s astir,&#x201D; said the rigger. &#x201C;He&#x0027;s a lively<lb/>
chief mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now,<lb/>
I must turn to.&#x201D; And so saying he went on deck, and we<lb/>
followed.</p>
<p>It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in<lb/>
twos and threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates<lb/>
were actively engaged; and several of the shore people were<lb/>
busy in bringing various last things on board. Meanwhile<lb/>
Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d22" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">merry christmas</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">At</hi> length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the<lb/>
wharf, and after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a<lb/>
whaleboat, with her last gift&#x2014;a night-cap for Stubb, the second<lb/>
mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward&#x2014;<lb/>
fter all this, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from<lb/>
the cabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?<lb/>
Captain Ahab is all ready&#x2014;just spoke to him&#x2014;nothing more to<lb/>
be got from shore, eh? Well, call all hands, then. Muster<lb/>
&#x0027;em aft here&#x2014;blast &#x0027;em!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,&#x201D;<lb/>
said Bildad, &#x201C;but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our<lb/>
bidding.&#x201D;</p>
<p>How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n150" n="113"/>
voyage, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with<lb/>
a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if they were to be<lb/>
joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port.<lb/>
And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen;<lb/>
only, they said he was in the cabin. But then, the idea was,<lb/>
that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship<lb/>
under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that<lb/>
was not at all his proper business, but the pilot&#x0027;s; and as he was<lb/>
not yet completely recovered&#x2014;so they said&#x2014;therefore, Captain<lb/>
Ahab stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough;<lb/>
especially as in the merchant service many captains never show<lb/>
themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the<lb/>
anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell<lb/>
merry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship<lb/>
for good with the pilot.</p>
<p>But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for<lb/>
Captain Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of<lb/>
the talking and commanding, and not Bildad.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,&#x201D; he cried, as the sailors<lb/>
lingered at the main-mast. &#x201C;Mr. Starbuck, drive &#x0027;em aft.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Strike the tent there!&#x201D;&#x2014;was the next order. As I hinted<lb/>
before, this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in<lb/>
port; and on board the Pequod, for thirty years, the order to<lb/>
strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving<lb/>
up the anchor.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!&#x2014;jump!&#x201D;&#x2014;was the<lb/>
next command, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.</p>
<p>Now, in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied<lb/>
by the pilot is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad,<lb/>
who, with Peleg, be it known, in addition to his other offices,<lb/>
was one of the licensed pilots of the port&#x2014;he being suspected<lb/>
to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket<lb/>
pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never<lb/>
piloted any other craft&#x2014;Bildad, I say, might now be seen ac-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n151" n="114"/>
tively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching<lb/>
anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of<lb/>
psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth<lb/>
some sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with<lb/>
hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad<lb/>
had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board<lb/>
the Pequod, particularly in getting under weigh; and Charity,<lb/>
his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each<lb/>
seaman&#x0027;s berth.</p>
<p>Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain<lb/>
Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner.<lb/>
I almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could<lb/>
be got up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike, and told<lb/>
Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran,<lb/>
in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was<lb/>
comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious<lb/>
Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hun-<lb/>
dred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke<lb/>
in my rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of<lb/>
Captain Peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my im-<lb/>
mediate vicinity. That was my first kick.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?&#x201D; he<lb/>
roared. &#x201C;Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy back-<lb/>
bone! Why don&#x0027;t ye spring, I say, all of ye&#x2014;spring! Quo-<lb/>
hag! spring, thou chap with the red whiskers; spring there,<lb/>
Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I say, all of ye,<lb/>
and spring your eyes out!&#x201D; And so saying, he moved along<lb/>
the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while im-<lb/>
perturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks<lb/>
I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.</p>
<p>At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we<lb/>
glided. It was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern<lb/>
day merged into night, we found ourselves almost broad upon<lb/>
the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n152" n="115"/>
polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks<lb/>
glistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of<lb/>
some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the<lb/>
bows.</p>
<p>Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and<lb/>
anon, as the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent<lb/>
the shivering frost all over her, and the<lb/>
winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were heard,&#x2014;</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>&#x201C;Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,</l>
<l rend="indent">Stand dressed in living green.</l>
<l>So to the Jews old Canaan stood,</l>
<l rend="indent">While Jordan rolled between.&#x201D;</l>
</lg>
<p>Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than<lb/>
then. They were full of hope and fruition. Spite of this<lb/>
frigid winter night in the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet<lb/>
feet and wetter jacket, there was yet, it then seemed to me,<lb/>
many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and glades so<lb/>
eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring, untrodden,<lb/>
unwilted, remains at midsummer.</p>
<p>At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were<lb/>
needed no longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied<lb/>
us began ranging alongside.</p>
<p>It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad<lb/>
were affected at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For<lb/>
loath to depart, yet; very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound<lb/>
on so long and perilous a voyage&#x2014;beyond both stormy Capes;<lb/>
a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were<lb/>
invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate sailed as captain; a<lb/>
man almost as old as he, once more starting to encounter all the<lb/>
terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to a thing so<lb/>
every way brimful of every interest to him,&#x2014;poor old Bildad<lb/>
lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down<lb/>
into the cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n153" n="116"/>
on deck, and looked to windward; looked towards the wide and<lb/>
endless waters, only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern<lb/>
Continents; looked towards the land; looked aloft; looked right<lb/>
and left; looked everywhere and nowhere; and at last, me-<lb/>
chanically coiling a rope upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout<lb/>
Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment<lb/>
stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say, &#x201C;Never-<lb/>
theless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but<lb/>
for all his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye,<lb/>
when the lantern came too near. And he, too, did not a little<lb/>
run from cabin to deck&#x2014;now a word below, and now a word<lb/>
with Starbuck, the chief mate.</p>
<p>But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look<lb/>
about him,&#x2014;&#x201C;Captain Bildad&#x2014;come, old shipmate, we must go.<lb/>
Back the main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come<lb/>
close alongside, now! Careful, careful!&#x2014;come, Bildad, boy&#x2014;<lb/>
say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck&#x2014;luck to ye, Mr. Stubb&#x2014;<lb/>
luck to ye, Mr. Flask&#x2014;good-bye, and good luck to ye all&#x2014;and<lb/>
this day three years I&#x0027;ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old<lb/>
Nantucket. Hurrah and away!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,&#x201D; mur-<lb/>
mured old Bildad, almost incoherently. &#x201C;I hope ye&#x0027;ll have fine<lb/>
weather now, so that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among<lb/>
ye&#x2014;a pleasant sun is all he needs, and ye&#x0027;ll have plenty of them<lb/>
in the tropic voyage ye go. Be careful in the hunt, ye mates.<lb/>
Don&#x0027;t stave the boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good white<lb/>
cedar plank is raised full three per cent, within the year. Don&#x0027;t<lb/>
forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind that cooper<lb/>
don&#x0027;t waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in the green<lb/>
locker! Don&#x0027;t whale it too much a&#x0027; Lord&#x0027;s days, men; but<lb/>
don&#x0027;t miss a fair chance either, that&#x0027;s rejecting Heaven&#x0027;s good<lb/>
gifts. Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was<lb/>
a little leaky, I thought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n154" n="117"/>
beware of fornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don&#x0027;t keep that<lb/>
cheese too long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it&#x0027;ll spoil.<lb/>
Be careful with the butter&#x2014;twenty cents the pound it was, and<lb/>
mind ye, if&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,&#x2014;away!&#x201D;<lb/>
and with that, Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt<lb/>
into the boat.</p>
<p>Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew<lb/>
between; a screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls<lb/>
wildly rolled; we gave three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly<lb/>
plunged like fate into the lone Atlantic.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Some</hi> chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall,<lb/>
new-landed mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.</p>
<p>When on that shivering winter&#x0027;s night, the Pequod thrust<lb/>
her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should<lb/>
I see standing at her helm but Bulkington! I looked with<lb/>
sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-<lb/>
winter just landed from a four years&#x0027; dangerous voyage, could<lb/>
so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term.<lb/>
The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things<lb/>
are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;<lb/>
this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let<lb/>
me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed<lb/>
ship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port<lb/>
would fain give succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety,<lb/>
comfort, hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that&#x0027;s<lb/>
kind to our mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n155" n="118"/>
is that ship&#x0027;s direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one<lb/>
touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her<lb/>
shudder through and through. With all her might she<lb/>
crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights &#x0027;gainst the very<lb/>
winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all the lashed<lb/>
sea&#x0027;s landlessness again; for refuge&#x0027;s sake forlornly rushing into<lb/>
peril; her only friend her bitterest foe.</p>
<p>Know ye, now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of<lb/>
that mortally intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking<lb/>
is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independ-<lb/>
ence of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth<lb/>
conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?</p>
<p>But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shore-<lb/>
less, indefinite as God&#x2014;so, better is it to perish in that howl-<lb/>
ing infinite, than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if<lb/>
that were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would craven<lb/>
crawl to land! Terrors of the terrible! is all this agony so<lb/>
vain? Take heart, take heart, O Bulkington! Bear thee<lb/>
grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy ocean-perishing&#x2014;<lb/>
straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!</p>

<hi rend="sc">the advocate</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">As</hi> Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business<lb/>
of whaling; and as this business of whaling has somehow come<lb/>
to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and dis-<lb/>
reputable pursuit; therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye,<lb/>
ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of<lb/>
whales.</p>
<p>In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n156" n="119"/>
establish the fact, that among people at large, the business of<lb/>
whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the<lb/>
liberal professions. If a stranger were introduced into any<lb/>
miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but slightly advance<lb/>
the general opinion of his merits, were he presented to the<lb/>
company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the<lb/>
naval officers he should append the initials S. W. F. (Sperm<lb/>
Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would<lb/>
be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honor-<lb/>
ing us whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation<lb/>
amounts to a butchering sort of business; and that when actively<lb/>
engaged therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements.<lb/>
Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and butchers<lb/>
of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders<lb/>
whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as for the<lb/>
matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall<lb/>
soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally<lb/>
unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant<lb/>
the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of<lb/>
this tidy earth. But even granting the charge in question to<lb/>
be true; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are<lb/>
comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields<lb/>
from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies&#x0027;<lb/>
plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the<lb/>
popular conceit of the soldier&#x0027;s profession; let me assure ye<lb/>
that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery,<lb/>
would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head. For what<lb/>
are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the inter-<lb/>
linked terrors and wonders of God!</p>
<p>But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does<lb/>
it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-<lb/>
abounding adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n157" n="120"/>
candles that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many<lb/>
shrines, to our glory!</p>
<p>But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts<lb/>
of scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.</p>
<p>Why did the Dutch in De Witt&#x0027;s time have admirals of their<lb/>
whaling fleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own<lb/>
personal expense, fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and<lb/>
politely invite to that town some score or two of families from<lb/>
our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the<lb/>
years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards<lb/>
of &#x0024;1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of<lb/>
America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen<lb/>
in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels;<lb/>
manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000<lb/>
of dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing, &#x0024;20,000,000;<lb/>
and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest<lb/>
of &#x0024;7,000,000. How comes all this, if there be not something<lb/>
puissant in whaling?</p>
<p>But this is not the half; look again.</p>
<p>I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for<lb/>
his life, point out one single peaceful influence, which within the<lb/>
last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole<lb/>
broad world, taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty<lb/>
business of whaling. One way and another, it has begotten events<lb/>
so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in<lb/>
their sequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as<lb/>
that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves pregnant<lb/>
from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to<lb/>
catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many<lb/>
years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out<lb/>
the remotest and least known parts of the earth. She has<lb/>
explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart, where<lb/>
no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and<lb/>
European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n158" n="121"/>
harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and the glory of the<lb/>
whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first in-<lb/>
terpreted between them and the savages. They may celebrate<lb/>
as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cookes,<lb/>
your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Cap-<lb/>
tains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and<lb/>
greater than your Cooke and your Krusenstern. For in their<lb/>
succorless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked<lb/>
waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,<lb/>
battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cooke with all his<lb/>
marines and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that<lb/>
is made such a flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those<lb/>
things were but the life-time commonplaces of our heroic<lb/>
Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver dedi-<lb/>
cates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of<lb/>
being set down in the ship&#x0027;s common log. Ah, the world! Oh,<lb/>
the world!</p>
<p>Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce<lb/>
but colonial, scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried<lb/>
on between Europe and the long line of the opulent Spanish<lb/>
provinces on the Pacific coast. It was the whaleman who first<lb/>
broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown, touching<lb/>
those colonies; and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly<lb/>
shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the libera-<lb/>
tion of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain,<lb/>
and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.</p>
<p>That great America on the other side of the sphere, Aus-<lb/>
tralia, was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman.<lb/>
After its first blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other<lb/>
ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but<lb/>
the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true<lb/>
mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy<lb/>
of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several<lb/>
times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n159" n="122"/>
whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The<lb/>
uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and<lb/>
do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way<lb/>
for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried<lb/>
the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that<lb/>
double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the<lb/>
whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already<lb/>
she is on the threshold.</p>
<p>But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling<lb/>
has no &#x00E6;sthetically noble associations connected with it, then am<lb/>
I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you<lb/>
with a split helmet every time.</p>
<p>The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous<lb/>
chronicler, you will say.</p>
<p><hi rend="i">The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chro-<lb/>
nicler?</hi> Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who<lb/>
but mighty Job! And who composed the first narrative of a<lb/>
whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than Alfred the<lb/>
Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from<lb/>
Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who<lb/>
pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but<lb/>
Edmund Burke!</p>
<p>True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils;<lb/>
they have no good blood in their veins.</p>
<p><hi rend="i">No good blood in their veins?</hi> They have something better<lb/>
than royal blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Frank-<lb/>
lin was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger,<lb/>
one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress to a<lb/>
long line of Folgers and harpooneers&#x2014;all kith and kin to noble<lb/>
Benjamin&#x2014;this day darting the barbed iron from one side of<lb/>
the world to the other.</p>
<p>Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is<lb/>
not respectable.</p>
<p><hi rend="i">Whaling not respectable?</hi> Whaling is imperial! By<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n160" n="123"/>
old English statutory law, the whale is declared &#x201C;a royal<lb/>
fish.&#x201D;<note xml:id="fn1-123"><p>See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.</p></note></p>
<p>Oh, that&#x0027;s only nominal! The whale himself has never<lb/>
figured in any grand imposing way.</p>
<p><hi rend="i">The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?</hi> In<lb/>
one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon<lb/>
his entering the world&#x0027;s capital, the bones of a whale, brought<lb/>

object in the cymballed procession.&#x002A;</p>
<p>Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is<lb/>
no real dignity in whaling.</p>
<p><hi rend="i">No dignity in whaling?</hi> The dignity of our calling the<lb/>

lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty whales. I account<lb/>
that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity<lb/>
who boasted of taking as many walled towns.</p>
<p>And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet<lb/>
undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real<lb/>
repute in that small but high hushed world which I might<lb/>

than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or<lb/>

<p><hi rend="sc">In</hi> behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance<lb/>
naught but substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts,<lb/>
an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable<lb/>
surmise, which might tell eloquently upon his cause&#x2014;such an<lb/>
advocate, would he not be blameworthy?</p>
<p>It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens,<lb/>
even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them<lb/>
for their functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state,<lb/>
so called, and there may be a caster of state. How they use<lb/>
the salt, precisely&#x2014;who knows? Certain I am, however, that<lb/>
a king&#x0027;s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head<lb/>
of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of<lb/>
making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery? Much<lb/>
might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of<lb/>
this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly<lb/>
and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably<lb/>
smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses<lb/>
hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy<lb/>
spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can&#x0027;t amount to<lb/>
much in his totality.</p>
<p>But the only thing to be considered here, is this&#x2014;what kind<lb/>
of oil is used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil,<lb/>
nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear&#x0027;s oil, nor<lb/>
train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in<lb/>
its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?</p>
<p>Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your<lb/>
kings and queens with coronation stuff!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">knights and squires</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of<lb/>
Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest<lb/>
man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to<lb/>
endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked<lb/>
biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not<lb/>
spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time<lb/>
of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days<lb/>
for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers<lb/>
had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical<lb/>
superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed<lb/>
no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it<lb/>
seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely<lb/>
the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;<lb/>
quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit;<lb/>
and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health<lb/>
and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed pre-<lb/>
pared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always,<lb/>
as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent<lb/>
chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in<lb/>
all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there<lb/>
the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had<lb/>
calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose<lb/>
life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not<lb/>
a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and<lb/>
fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times<lb/>
affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all<lb/>
the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n163" n="126"/>
with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his<lb/>
life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to<lb/>
that sort of superstition, which in some organizations seems<lb/>
rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from igno-<lb/>
rance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his.<lb/>
And if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul,<lb/>
much more did his far-away domestic memories of his young<lb/>
Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from<lb/>
the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further<lb/>
to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted men,<lb/>
restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others<lb/>
in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. &#x201C;I will have no<lb/>
man in my boat,&#x201D; said Starbuck, &#x201C;who is not afraid of a whale.&#x201D;<lb/>
By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable<lb/>
and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estima-<lb/>
tion of the encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man<lb/>
is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye,&#x201D; said Stubb, the second mate, &#x201C;Starbuck, there,<lb/>
is as careful a man as you&#x0027;ll find anywhere in this fishery.&#x201D;<lb/>
But we shall ere long see what that word &#x201C;careful&#x201D; precisely<lb/>
means when used by a man like Stbub, or almost any other<lb/>
whale hunter.</p>
<p>Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was<lb/>
not a sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always<lb/>
at hand upon all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he<lb/>
thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling, courage was<lb/>
one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her beef and her<lb/>
bread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no<lb/>
fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor for persisting<lb/>
in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him.<lb/>
For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill<lb/>
whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs;<lb/>
and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well<lb/>
knew. What doom was his own father&#x0027;s? Where, in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n164" n="127"/>
the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of his<lb/>
brother?</p>
<p>With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a<lb/>
certain superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this<lb/>
Starbuck which could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed<lb/>
have been extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature that<lb/>
a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences and<lb/>
remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that these<lb/>
things should fail in latently engendering an element in him,<lb/>
which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its<lb/>
confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he<lb/>
might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some<lb/>
intrepid men, which, while generally abiding firm in the conflict<lb/>
with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the ordinary irrational<lb/>
horrors of the world, yet cannot withstand those more terrific,<lb/>
because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you<lb/>
from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.</p>
<p>But were the coming narrative to reveal, in any instance, the<lb/>
complete abasement of poor Starbuck&#x0027;s fortitude, scarce might<lb/>
I have the heart to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful,<lb/>
nay shocking, to expose the fall of valor in the soul. Men<lb/>
may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations;<lb/>
knaves, fools, and murderers there may be; men may have<lb/>
mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and<lb/>
so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any<lb/>
ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw<lb/>
their costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within<lb/>
ourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all the<lb/>
outer character seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the<lb/>
undraped spectacle of a valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself,<lb/>
at such a shameful sight, completely stifle her upbraidings<lb/>
against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I treat<lb/>
of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding<lb/>
dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n165" n="128"/>
shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that<lb/>
democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end<lb/>
from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre<lb/>
and circumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our<lb/>
divine equality!</p>
<p>If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I<lb/>
shall hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round<lb/>
them tragic graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the<lb/>
most abased, among them all, shall at times lift himself to the<lb/>
exalted mounts; if I shall touch that workman&#x0027;s arm with some<lb/>
ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous<lb/>
set of sun; then against all mortal critics hear me out in it, thou<lb/>
just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one royal mantle of<lb/>
humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great<lb/>
democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,<lb/>
Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with<lb/>
doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and pau-<lb/>
pered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew<lb/>
Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-<lb/>
horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou<lb/>
who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy<lb/>
selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in<lb/>
it, O God!</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Stubb</hi> was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod;<lb/>
and hence, according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man.<lb/>
A happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor valiant; taking perils<lb/>
as they came with an indifferent air; and while engaged in the<lb/>
most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and col-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n166" n="129"/>
lected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year. Good-<lb/>
humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his whale-boat as<lb/>
if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his crew<lb/>
all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable<lb/>
arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is<lb/>
about the snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in<lb/>
the very death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance<lb/>
coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He<lb/>
would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with<lb/>
the most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb,<lb/>
converted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he<lb/>
thought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever<lb/>
thought of it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did<lb/>
chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner,<lb/>
no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of<lb/>
the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about<lb/>
something which he would find out when he obeyed the order,<lb/>
and not sooner.</p>
<p>What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-<lb/>
going, unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden<lb/>
of life in a world full of grave peddlers, all bowed to the ground<lb/>
with their packs; what helped to bring about that almost impious<lb/>
good-humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. For,<lb/>
like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular<lb/>
features of his face. You would almost as soon have expected<lb/>
him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe.<lb/>
He kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in a<lb/>
rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned<lb/>
in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from the<lb/>
other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be<lb/>
in readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first<lb/>
putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his<lb/>
mouth.</p>
<p>I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n167" n="130"/>
least, of his peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this<lb/>
earthly air, whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the<lb/>
nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died ex-<lb/>
haling it; and as in time of the cholera, some people go about<lb/>
with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise,<lb/>
against all mortal tribulations, Stubb&#x0027;s tobacco smoke might<lb/>
have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.</p>
<p>The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha&#x0027;s<lb/>
Vineyard. A short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious<lb/>
concerning whales, who somehow seemed to think that the<lb/>
great Leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him;<lb/>
and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him, to de-<lb/>
stroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to<lb/>
all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic<lb/>
bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an appre-<lb/>
hension of any possible danger from encountering them; that in<lb/>
his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of mag-<lb/>
nified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little cir-<lb/>
cumvention and some small application of time and trouble in<lb/>
order to kill and boil. This ignorant, unconscious fearlessness<lb/>
of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales; he<lb/>
followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years&#x0027; voyage<lb/>
round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length<lb/>
of time. As a carpenter&#x0027;s nails are divided into wrought nails<lb/>
and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little<lb/>
Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and<lb/>
last long. They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod;<lb/>
because, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square<lb/>
limber known by that name in Arctic whalers; and which by<lb/>
the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it, serves<lb/>
brace the ship against the icy concussions of those batter-<lb/>
ing seas.</p>
<p>Now these three mates&#x2014;Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were<lb/>
momentous men. They it was who by universal prescription<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n168" n="131"/>
commanded three of the Pequod&#x0027;s boats as headsmen. In that<lb/>
grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably<lb/>
marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three heads-<lb/>
men were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with<lb/>
their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of<lb/>
lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.</p>
<p>And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman,<lb/>
like a Gothic Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-<lb/>
steerer or harpooneer, who in certain conjunctures provides him<lb/>
with a fresh lance, when the former one has been badly twisted,<lb/>
or elbowed in the assault; and moreover, as there generally sub-<lb/>
sists between the two, a close intimacy and friendliness; it is<lb/>
therefore but meet, that in this place we set down who the Pe-<lb/>
quod&#x0027;s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of them<lb/>
belonged.</p>
<p>First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate,<lb/>
had selected for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.</p>
<p>Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the<lb/>
most westerly promontory of Martha&#x0027;s Vineyard, where there<lb/>
still exists the last remnant of a village of red men, which has<lb/>
long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many<lb/>
of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go<lb/>
by the generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego&#x0027;s long, lean,<lb/>
sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes&#x2014;<lb/>
or an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glit-<lb/>
tering expression&#x2014;all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inhe-<lb/>
ritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who,<lb/>
in quest of the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in<lb/>
hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer snuff<lb/>
ng in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego<lb/>
now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the<lb/>
unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow<lb/>
of the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky<lb/>
limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n169" n="132"/>
of the earlier Puritans, and half believed this wild Indian to be<lb/>
a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air. Tashtego was<lb/>
Stubb the second mate&#x0027;s squire.</p>
<p>Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-<lb/>
black negro-savage, with a lion-like tread&#x2014;an Ahasuerus to be-<lb/>
hold. Suspended from his ears were two golden hoops, so large<lb/>
that the sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of secur-<lb/>
ing the top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had<lb/>
voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay<lb/>
on his native coast. And never having been anywhere in the<lb/>
world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors<lb/>
most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many<lb/>
years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncom-<lb/>
monly heedful of what manner of men they shipped; Daggoo<lb/>
retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a giraffe, moved<lb/>
about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks.<lb/>
There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a<lb/>
white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg<lb/>
truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Aha-<lb/>
suerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a<lb/>
chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod&#x0027;s<lb/>
company, be it said, that at the present day not one in two of<lb/>
the many thousand men before the mast employed in the Ame-<lb/>
rican whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all<lb/>
the officers are. Herein it is the same with the American<lb/>
whale fishery as with the American army and military and<lb/>
merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the<lb/>
construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The<lb/>
same, I say, because in all these cases the native American libe-<lb/>
rally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously<lb/>
supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling<lb/>
seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound Nan-<lb/>
tucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the<lb/>
hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n170" n="133"/>
Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the<lb/>
Shetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew.<lb/>
Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again. How<lb/>
it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best<lb/>
whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, <hi rend="i">Isolatoes</hi><lb/>
too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men,<lb/>
but each <hi rend="i">Isolato</hi> living on a separate continent of his own. Yet<lb/>
now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!<lb/>
An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and<lb/>
all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod<lb/>
to lay the world&#x0027;s grievances before that bar from which not very<lb/>
many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip&#x2014;he never<lb/>
did&#x2014;oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the<lb/>
grim Pequod&#x0027;s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his<lb/>
tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to<lb/>
the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels,<lb/>
and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed<lb/>
a hero there!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">ahab</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">For</hi> several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above<lb/>
hatches was seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly<lb/>
relieved each other at the watches, and for aught that could be<lb/>
seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders<lb/>
of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with<lb/>
orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they<lb/>
but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dic-<lb/>
tator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not per-<lb/>
mitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.</p>
<pb xml:id="n171" n="134"/>
<p>Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I<lb/>
instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for<lb/>
my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain, now<lb/>
in the seclusion of the sea, became almost a perturbation. This<lb/>
was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah&#x0027;s dia-<lb/>
bolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle<lb/>
energy I could not have before conceived of. But poorly could<lb/>
I withstand them, much as in other moods I was almost ready<lb/>
to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet<lb/>
of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or<lb/>
uneasiness&#x2014;to call it so&#x2014;which I felt, yet whenever I came to<lb/>
look about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to<lb/>
cherish such emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the<lb/>
great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish,<lb/>
and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies<lb/>
which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with,<lb/>
still I ascribed this&#x2014;and rightly ascribed it&#x2014;to the fierce<lb/>
uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation<lb/>
in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was espe-<lb/>
cially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates,<lb/>
which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colorless mis-<lb/>
givings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every present-<lb/>
ment of the voyage. Three better, more likely sea-officers and<lb/>
men, each in his own different way, could not readily be found,<lb/>
and they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a<lb/>
Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the<lb/>
ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had biting<lb/>
Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to<lb/>
the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude<lb/>
which we sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and<lb/>
all its intolerable weather behind us. It was one of those less<lb/>
lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the<lb/>
transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through<lb/>
the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n172" n="135"/>
rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the fore-<lb/>
noon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail.<lb/>
foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;<lb/>
Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.</p>
<p>There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him,<lb/>
nor of the recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away<lb/>
from the stake, when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the<lb/>
limbs without consuming them, or taking away one particle from<lb/>
their compacted aged robustness. His whole high, broad form,<lb/>
seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable<lb/>
mould, like Cellini&#x0027;s cast Perseus. Threading its way out from<lb/>
among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his<lb/>
tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his cloth-<lb/>
ing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It<lb/>
resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the<lb/>
straight, lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper lightning<lb/>
tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a single twig,<lb/>
peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom, ere running<lb/>
off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded.<lb/>
Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the<lb/>
scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say,<lb/>
By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allu-<lb/>
sion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tash-<lb/>
tego&#x0027;s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,<lb/>
superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old<lb/>
did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon<lb/>
him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental<lb/>
strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived,<lb/>
by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,<lb/>
who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere<lb/>
this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-<lb/>
traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old<lb/>
Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that<lb/>
no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n173" n="136"/>
ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out&#x2014;which might<lb/>
hardly come to pass, so he muttered&#x2014;then, whoever should do<lb/>
that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him<lb/>
from crown to sole.</p>
<p>So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me,<lb/>
and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few<lb/>
moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing<lb/>
grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he<lb/>
partly stood. It had previously come to me that this ivory leg<lb/>
had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s jaw. &#x201C;Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,&#x201D; said the old<lb/>
Gay-Head Indian once; &#x201C;but like his dismasted craft, he shipped<lb/>
another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of<lb/>
&#x0027;em.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon<lb/>
each side of the Pequod&#x0027;s quarter deck, and pretty close to the<lb/>
mizen shrouds, there was an auger hole, bored about half an<lb/>
inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole;<lb/>
one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood<lb/>
erect, looking straight out beyond the ship&#x0027;s ever-pitching prow.<lb/>
There was an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsur-<lb/>
renderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedica-<lb/>
tion of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his officers<lb/>
say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures and<lb/>
expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful, con-<lb/>
sciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not<lb/>
only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a<lb/>
crucifixion in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing<lb/>
dignity of some mighty woe.</p>
<p>Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his<lb/>
cabin. But after that morning, he was every day visible to the<lb/>
crew; either standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory<lb/>
stool he had; or heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew<lb/>
less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he became<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n174" n="137"/>
still less and less a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from<lb/>
home, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had<lb/>
then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it came to pass,<lb/>
that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet, for all<lb/>
that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck,<lb/>
he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the<lb/>
Pequod was only making a passage now; not regularly cruis-<lb/>
ing; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the<lb/>
mates were fully competent to, so that there was little or nothing,<lb/>
out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and thus chase<lb/>
away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer<lb/>
were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest<lb/>
peaks to pile themselves upon.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of<lb/>
the pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to<lb/>
charm him from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked,<lb/>
dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry, misan-<lb/>
thropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven<lb/>
old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to wel-<lb/>
come such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little<lb/>
respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More than<lb/>
once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in<lb/>
any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d29" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXIX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">enter ahab; to him, stubb</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Some</hi> days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the<lb/>
Pequod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring,<lb/>
which, at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the<lb/>
eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing,<lb/>
perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n175" n="138"/>
of Persian sherbet, heaped up&#x2014;flaked up, with rose-water<lb/>
snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in<lb/>
jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory<lb/>
of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns!<lb/>
For sleeping man, &#x0027;twas hard to choose between such winsome<lb/>
days and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that<lb/>
unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and poten-<lb/>
cies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the soul,<lb/>
especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then,<lb/>
memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noise-<lb/>
less twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more and more<lb/>
they wrought on Ahab&#x0027;s texture.</p>
<p>Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the<lb/>
less man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among<lb/>
sea-commanders, the old grey beards will oftenest leave their berths<lb/>
to visit the night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only<lb/>
that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open air,<lb/>
that truly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from<lb/>
the cabin to the planks. &#x201C;It feels like going down into one&#x0027;s<lb/>
tomb,&#x201D;&#x2014;he would mutter to himself,&#x2014;&#x201C;for an old captain like<lb/>
me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my grave-dug<lb/>
berth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the<lb/>
night were set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers<lb/>
of the band below; and when if a rope was to be hauled upon<lb/>
the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as by day,<lb/>
but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place, for fear of dis-<lb/>
turbing their slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady<lb/>
quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the silent steersman<lb/>
would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man would<lb/>
emerge, griping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way.<lb/>
Some considerating touch of humanity was in him; for at times<lb/>
like these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-<lb/>
deck; because to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n176" n="139"/>
inches of his ivory heel, such would have been the reverberating<lb/>
crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams would have<lb/>
been of the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was<lb/>
on him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy,<lb/>
lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to<lb/>
mainmast, Stubb, the odd second mate, came up from below,<lb/>
and with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted<lb/>
that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no<lb/>
one could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling<lb/>
the noise; hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about<lb/>
a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah!<lb/>
Stubb, thou did&#x0027;st not know Ahab then.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,&#x201D; said Ahab, &#x201C;that thou<lb/>
wouldst wad me that fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot.<lb/>
Below to thy nightly grave; where such as ye sleep between<lb/>
shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.&#x2014;Down, dog, and<lb/>
kennel!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Starting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so<lb/>
suddenly scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment;<lb/>
then said excitedly, &#x201C;I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir;<lb/>
I do but less than half like it, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Avast!&#x201D; gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently<lb/>
moving away, as if to avoid some passionate temptation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, sir; not yet,&#x201D; said Stubb, emboldened, &#x201C;I will not tamely<lb/>
be called a dog, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass,<lb/>
and begone, or I&#x0027;ll clear the world of thee!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such over-<lb/>
bearing terrors in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for<lb/>
it,&#x201D; muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-<lb/>
scuttle. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I<lb/>
don&#x0027;t well know whether to go back and strike him, or&#x2014;what&#x0027;s<lb/>
that?&#x2014;down here on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n177" n="140"/>
was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the first<lb/>
time I ever <hi rend="i">did</hi> pray. It&#x0027;s queer; very queer; and he&#x0027;s queer<lb/>
too; aye, take him fore and aft, he&#x0027;s about the queerest old<lb/>
man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!&#x2014;his eyes<lb/>
like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway there&#x0027;s something on<lb/>
his mind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when<lb/>
it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three<lb/>
hours out of the twenty-four; and he don&#x0027;t sleep then. Didn&#x0027;t<lb/>
that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he<lb/>
always finds the old man&#x0027;s hammock clothes all rumpled and<lb/>
tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid<lb/>
almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as<lb/>
though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I<lb/>
guess he&#x0027;s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it&#x0027;s a<lb/>
kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say&#x2014;worse nor a toothache. Well,<lb/>
well; I don&#x0027;t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from<lb/>
catching it. He&#x0027;s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into<lb/>
the after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he sus-<lb/>
pects; what&#x0027;s that for, I should like to know? Who&#x0027;s made ap-<lb/>
pointments with him in the hold? Ain&#x0027;t that queer, now? But<lb/>
there&#x0027;s no telling, it&#x0027;s the old game&#x2014;Here goes for a snooze.<lb/>
Damn me, it&#x0027;s worth a fellow&#x0027;s while to be born into the world,<lb/>
if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it, that&#x0027;s<lb/>
about the first thing babies do, and that&#x0027;s a sort of queer, too.<lb/>
Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of &#x0027;em. But<lb/>
that&#x0027;s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh com-<lb/>
mandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth&#x2014;So here<lb/>
goes again. But how&#x0027;s that? didn&#x0027;t he call me a dog? blazes!<lb/>
he called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on<lb/>
top of <hi rend="i">that</hi>! He might as well have kicked me, and done with<lb/>
it. Maybe he <hi rend="i">did</hi> kick me, and I didn&#x0027;t observe it I was so<lb/>
taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a<lb/>
bleached bone. What the devil&#x0027;s the matter with me? I don&#x0027;t<lb/>
stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n178" n="141"/>
sort of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have<lb/>
been dreaming, though&#x2014;How? how? how?&#x2014;but the only<lb/>
way&#x0027;s to stash it; so here goes to hammock again; and in the<lb/>
morning, I&#x0027;ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by day-<lb/>
light.&#x201D;</p>

<hi rend="sc">the pipe</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">When</hi> Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning<lb/>
over the bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of<lb/>
late, calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for<lb/>
his ivory stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the<lb/>
binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the<lb/>
deck, he sat and smoked.</p>
<p>In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings<lb/>were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale.<lb/>
How could one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod<lb/>
of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized?<lb/>
For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great<lb/>
lord of Leviathans was Ahab.</p>
<p>Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from<lb/>
his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into<lb/>
his face. &#x201C;How now,&#x201D; he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the<lb/>
tube, &#x201C;this smoking no longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard<lb/>
must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here have I been<lb/>
unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring,&#x2014;aye, and ignorantly<lb/>
smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with<lb/>
such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets<lb/>
were the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have<lb/>
I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to<lb/>
send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n179" n="142"/>
among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I&#x0027;ll smoke no<lb/>
more&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed<lb/>
in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the<lb/>
sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced<lb/>
the planks.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Next</hi> morning Stubb accosted Flask.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know<lb/>
the old man&#x0027;s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it;<lb/>
and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I<lb/>
kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a<lb/>
pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what<lb/>
was still more curious, Flask&#x2014;you know how curious all dreams<lb/>
are&#x2014;through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to<lb/>
be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an in-<lb/>
sult, that kick from Ahab. &#x2018;Why,&#x2019; thinks I, &#x2018;what&#x0027;s the row?<lb/>
It&#x0027;s not a real leg, only a false leg.&#x2019; And there&#x0027;s a mighty dif-<lb/>
ference between a living thump and a dead thump. That&#x0027;s<lb/>
what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty times more savage<lb/>
to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member&#x2014;that<lb/>
makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself<lb/>
all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against<lb/>
that cursed pyramid&#x2014;so confoundedly contradictory was it all,<lb/>
all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, &#x2018;what&#x0027;s his leg<lb/>
now, but a cane&#x2014;a whalebone cane. Yes,&#x2019; thinks I, &#x2018;it was<lb/>
only a playful cudgelling&#x2014;in fact, only a whaleboning that he<lb/>
gave me&#x2014;not a base kick. Besides,&#x2019; thinks I, &#x2018;look at it once;<lb/>
why, the end of it&#x2014;<lb/>
he foot part&#x2014;what a small sort of end it<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n180" n="143"/>
is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, <hi rend="i">there&#x0027;s</hi> a devil-<lb/>
ish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point<lb/>
only.&#x2019; But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.<lb/>
While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-<lb/>
haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the<lb/>
shoulders, and slews me round. &#x2018;What are you &#x2018;bout?&#x2019; says<lb/>
he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But,<lb/>
somehow, next moment I was over the fright. &#x2018;What am I<lb/>
about?&#x2019; says I at last. &#x2018;And what business is that of yours, I<lb/>
should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do <hi rend="i">you</hi> want a kick?&#x2019;<lb/>
By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned<lb/>
round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of sea-<lb/>
weed he had for a clout&#x2014;what do you think, I saw?&#x2014;why<lb/>
thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, &#x2018;I guess I won&#x0027;t<lb/>
kick you, old fellow.&#x2019; &#x2018;Wise Stubb,&#x2019; said he, &#x2018;wise Stubb;&#x2019; and<lb/>
kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums<lb/>
like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn&#x0027;t going to stop saying<lb/>
over his &#x2018;wise Stubb, wise Stubb,&#x2019; I thought I might as well fall<lb/>
to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my<lb/>
foot for it, when he roared out, &#x2018;Stop that kicking!&#x2019; &#x2018;Halloa,<lb/>
says I, &#x2018;what&#x0027;s the matter now, old fellow?&#x2019; &#x2018;Look ye here,<lb/>
rsquo; says he; &#x2018;let&#x0027;s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye,<lb/>
didn&#x0027;t he?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes, he did,&#x2019; says I&#x2014;&#x2018;right <hi rend="i">here</hi> it was.&#x2019; &#x2018;Very<lb/>
good,&#x2019; says he&#x2014; &#x2018;he used his ivory leg, didn&#x0027;t he?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes, he<lb/>
did,&#x2019; says I. &#x2018;Well then,&#x2019; says he, &#x2018;wise Stubb, what have you<lb/>
to complain of? Didn&#x0027;t he kick with right good will? it wasn&#x0027;t<lb/>
a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you were<lb/>
kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.<lb/>
It&#x0027;s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In<lb/>
old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped<lb/>
by a queen, and made garter-knights of; but, be <hi rend="i">your</hi> boast,<lb/>
Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man<lb/>
of. Remember what I say; <hi rend="i">be</hi> kicked by him; account his<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n181" n="144"/>
kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can&#x0027;t help<lb/>
yourself, wise Stubb. Don&#x0027;t you see that pyramid?&#x0027; With<lb/>
that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion,<lb/>
to swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I<lb/>
was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream,<lb/>
Flask?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho&#x0027;.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;May be; may be. But it&#x0027;s made a wise man of me, Flask.<lb/>
D&#x0027;ye see Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern?<lb/>
Well, the best thing you can do, Flask, is to let that old man<lb/>
alone; never speak to him, whatever he says. Halloa! what&#x0027;s<lb/>
that he shouts? Hark!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are<lb/>
whales hereabouts! If ye see a white one, split your lungs for<lb/>
him!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What d&#x0027;ye think of that now, Flask? ain&#x0027;t there a small<lb/>
drop of something queer about that, eh? A white whale&#x2014;did<lb/>
ye mark that, man? Look ye&#x2014;there&#x0027;s something special in the<lb/>
wind. Stand by for it, Flask. Ahab has that that&#x0027;s bloody on<lb/>
his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.&#x201D;</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Already</hi> we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon<lb/>
we shall be lost in its unshored, harborless immensities. Ere<lb/>
that come to pass; ere the Pequod&#x0027;s weedy hull rolls side<lb/>
by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the outset<lb/>
it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to<lb/>
a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special<lb/>
leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to<lb/>
follow.</p>
<pb xml:id="n182" n="145"/>
<p>It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad<lb/>
genera, that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy<lb/>
task. The classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing<lb/>
less is here essayed. Listen to what the best and latest author-<lb/>
ities have laid down.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is<lb/>
entitled Cetology,&#x201D; says Captain Scoresby, A. D. 1820.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into<lb/>
the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into<lb/>
groups and families. &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; Utter confusion exists among<lb/>
the historians of this animal&#x201D; (sperm whale), says Surgeon<lb/>
Beale, A. D. 1839.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable<lb/>
waters.&#x201D; &#x201C;Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the<lb/>
cetacea.&#x201D; &#x201C;A field strewn with thorns.&#x201D; &#x201C;All these incom-<lb/>
plete indications but serve to torture us naturalists.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter,<lb/>
and Lesson, those lights of zoology and anatomy. Never-<lb/>
theless, though of real knowledge there be little, yet of books<lb/>
there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with cetology,<lb/>
or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great,<lb/>
old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in<lb/>
little, written of the whale. Run over a few:&#x2014;The Authors of<lb/>
the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne;<lb/>
Gesner; Ray; Linn&#x00E6;us; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green;<lb/>
Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lac&#x00E9;p&#x00E8;de; Bonneterre;<lb/>
Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter;<lb/>
Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the Au-<lb/>
thor of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever.<lb/>
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have writ-<lb/>
ten, the above cited extracts will show.</p>
<p>Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those follow-<lb/>
ing Owen ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a<lb/>
real professional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n183" n="146"/>
Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or right-<lb/>
hale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew<lb/>
nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared<lb/>
with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mention-<lb/>
ing. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is<lb/>
an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any<lb/>
means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long<lb/>
priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till<lb/>
some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly<lb/>
unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day<lb/>
still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports;<lb/>
this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference<lb/>
to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past<lb/>
days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one<lb/>
rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has<lb/>
at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross;<lb/>
hear ye! good people all,&#x2014;the Greenland whale is deposed,&#x2014;-<lb/>
the great sperm whale now reigneth!</p>
<p>There are only two books in being which at all pretend to<lb/>
put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same time,<lb/>
in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books<lb/>
are Beale&#x0027;s and Bennett&#x0027;s; both in their time surgeons to<lb/>
English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men.<lb/>
The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in<lb/>
their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of<lb/>
excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or<lb/>
poetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all<lb/>
other hunted whales, his is an unwritten life.</p>
<p>Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular<lb/>
comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for<lb/>
the present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by sub-<lb/>
sequent laborers. As no better man advances to take this<lb/>
matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n184" n="147"/>
promise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed<lb/>
to be complete, must for that very reason infallibly be faulty.<lb/>
I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the<lb/>
various species, or&#x2014;in this place at least&#x2014;to much of any<lb/>
description. My object here is simply to project the draught of<lb/>
a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.</p>
<p>But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the<lb/>
Post-office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the<lb/>
sea after them; to have one&#x0027;s hands among the unspeakable<lb/>
foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful<lb/>
thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this<lb/>
leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me.<lb/>
&#x201C;Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee! Behold<lb/>
the hope of him is vain!&#x201D; But I have swam through libraries<lb/>
and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with<lb/>
these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are<lb/>
some preliminaries to settle.</p>
<p>First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Ce-<lb/>
tology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some<lb/>
quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a<lb/>
fish. In his System of Nature, A. D. 1776, Linn&#x00E6;us declares,<lb/>
&#x201C;I hereby separate the whales from the fish.&#x201D; But of my own<lb/>
knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and<lb/>
shad, alewives and herring, against Linn&#x00E6;us&#x0027;s express edict, were<lb/>
still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the<lb/>
Leviathan.</p>
<p>The grounds upon which Linn&#x00E6;us would fain have banished<lb/>
the whales from the waters, he states as follows: &#x201C;On account<lb/>
of their warm bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids,<lb/>
their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,&#x201D;<lb/>
and finally, &#x201C;ex lege natur&#x00E6; jure meritoque.&#x201D; I submitted all<lb/>
this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of<lb/>
Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and<lb/>
they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n185" n="148"/>
altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were<lb/>
humbug.</p>
<p>Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old<lb/>
fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy<lb/>
Jonah to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next<lb/>
point is, in what internal respect does the whale differ from<lb/>
other fish. Above, Linn&#x00E9;us has given you those items. But in<lb/>
brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all<lb/>
other fish are lungless and cold blooded.</p>
<p>Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious ex-<lb/>
ternals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come?<lb/>
To be short, then, a whale is <hi rend="i">a spouting fish with a horizontal<lb/>
tail.</hi> There you have him. However contracted, that defini-<lb/>
tion is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts<lb/>
much like a whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is<lb/>
amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more<lb/>
cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have<lb/>
noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat,<lb/>
but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting<lb/>
fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably<lb/>
assumes a horizontal position.</p>
<p>By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means<lb/>
exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature<lb/>
hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed<lb/>
Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish<lb/>
hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.<note xml:id="fn2-148"><p>I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins<lb/>
and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are<lb/>
included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish<lb/>
are a nosy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and<lb/>
feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their<lb/>
credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to<lb/>
quit the Kingdom of Cetology.</p></note> Hence, all the<lb/>
smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n186" n="149"/>
this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand<lb/>
divisions of the entire whale host.</p>
<p>First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into<lb/>
three primary BOOKS (subdivisible into <hi rend="sc">Chapters</hi>), and<lb/>
these shall comprehend them all, both small and large.</p>
<p>I. The <hi rend="sc">Folio Whale</hi>; II. the <hi rend="sc">Octavo Whale</hi>; III. the<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">Duodecimo Whale</hi>.</p>
<p>As the type of the <hi rend="sc">Folio</hi> I present the <hi rend="i">Sperm Whale</hi>; of<lb/>
the <hi rend="sc">Octavo</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Grampus</hi>; of the <hi rend="sc">Duodecimo</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Porpoise.</hi></p>
<p>FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chap-<lb/>
ters:&#x2014;I. The <hi rend="i">Sperm Whale</hi>; II. the <hi rend="i">Right Whale</hi>; III. the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Fin Back Whale</hi>; IV. the <hi rend="i">Hump-backed Whale</hi>; V. the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Razor Back Whale</hi>; VI. the <hi rend="i">Sulphur Bottom Whale.</hi></p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> I. (<hi rend="i">Sperm Whale</hi>).&#x2014;This whale,<lb/>
among the English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa<lb/>
whale, and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is<lb/>
the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the<lb/>
Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is,<lb/>
without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe; the most<lb/>
formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in<lb/>
aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he<lb/>
being the only creature from which that valuable substance,<lb/>
spermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many<lb/>
other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name<lb/>
that I now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd.<lb/>
Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly<lb/>
unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil was<lb/>
only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those<lb/>
days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be<lb/>
derived from a creature identical with the one then known in<lb/>
England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea<lb/>
also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of<lb/>
the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word<lb/>
literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was ex-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n187" n="150"/>
ceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an oint-<lb/>
ment and medicament. It was only to be had from the<lb/>
druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When,<lb/>
as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti<lb/>
became known, its original name was still retained by the<lb/>
dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely<lb/>
significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last<lb/>
have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this<lb/>
spermaceti was really derived.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> II. (<hi rend="i">Right Whale</hi>).&#x2014;In one re-<lb/>
spect this is the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one<lb/>
first regularly hunted by man. It yields the article commonly<lb/>
known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known as<lb/>
&#x201C;whale oil,&#x201D; an inferior article in commerce. Among the fish-<lb/>
ermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following<lb/>
titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale;<lb/>
the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There<lb/>
is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus<lb/>
multitudinously baptized. What then is the whale, which I<lb/>
include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great<lb/>
Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of<lb/>
the English whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French<lb/>
whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the<lb/>
whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted<lb/>
by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale<lb/>
which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian<lb/>
ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor&#x0027; West Coast, and<lb/>
various other parts of the world, designated by them Right<lb/>
Whale Cruising Grounds.</p>
<p>Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland<lb/>
whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans.<lb/>
But they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has<lb/>
there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which<lb/>
to ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n188" n="151"/>
based upon the most inconclusive differences, that some depart-<lb/>
ments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The<lb/>
right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with<lb/>
reference to elucidating the sperm whale.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> III. (<hi rend="i">Fin-Back</hi>).&#x2014;Under this<lb/>
head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of Fin<lb/>
-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every<lb/>
sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often<lb/>
descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York<lb/>
packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the<lb/>
Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth,<lb/>
and a lighter color, approaching to olive. His great lips present<lb/>
a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds of<lb/>
large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from<lb/>
which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This<lb/>
fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the<lb/>
hinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very<lb/>
sharp pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part of the<lb/>
creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly<lb/>
projecting from the surface. When the sea is moderately calm,<lb/>
and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this gaomon<lb/>
-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface,<lb/>
it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it<lb/>
somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines<lb/>
graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back.<lb/>
The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some<lb/>
men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unex-<lb/>
pectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen<lb/>
waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall mis-<lb/>
anthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous<lb/>
power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit<lb/>
from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquera-<lb/>
ble Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his<lb/>
back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n189" n="152"/>
sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic<lb/>
species denominated <hi rend="i">Whalebone whales</hi>, that is, whales with<lb/>
baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would<lb/>
seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little<lb/>
known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed<lb/>
whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated<lb/>
whales, are the fishermen&#x0027;s names for a few sorts.</p>
<p>In connexion with this appellative of &#x201C;Whalebone whales,&#x201D;<lb/>
it is of great importance to mention, that however such a nomen-<lb/>
clature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind<lb/>
of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification<lb/>
of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or<lb/>
fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features<lb/>
very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a<lb/>
regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily<lb/>
distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then?<lb/>
The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose<lb/>
peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of<lb/>
whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their<lb/>
structure in other and more essential particulars. Thus, the<lb/>
sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump;<lb/>
but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked<lb/>
whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but<lb/>
there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with<lb/>
the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,<lb/>
they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any<lb/>
one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to<lb/>
defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On<lb/>
this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.</p>
<p>But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts<lb/>
of the whale, in his anatomy&#x2014;there, at least, we shall be able<lb/>
to hit the right classification. Nay; what thing, for example,<lb/>
is there in the Greenland whale&#x0027;s anatomy more striking than<lb/>
his baleen? Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impos-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n190" n="153"/>
sible correctly to classify the Greenland whale. And if you<lb/>
descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you<lb/>
will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the<lb/>
systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What<lb/>
then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily,<lb/>
in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.<lb/>
And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is<lb/>
the only one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable.<lb/>
To proceed.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> IV. (<hi rend="i">Hump Back</hi>).&#x2014;This whale<lb/>
is often seen on the northern American coast. He has been<lb/>
frequently captured there, and towed into harbor. He has a<lb/>
great pack on him like a peddler; or you might call him the<lb/>
Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for<lb/>
him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale<lb/>
also has a hump, though a smaller one. His oil is not very valu-<lb/>
able. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-<lb/>
hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white<lb/>
water generally than any other of them.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> V. (<hi rend="i">Razor Back</hi>).&#x2014;Of this whale<lb/>
little is known but his name. I have seen him at a distance<lb/>
off Cape Horn. Of a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters<lb/>
and philosophers. Though no coward, he has never yet shown<lb/>
any part of him but his back, which rises in a long sharp ridge.<lb/>
Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does anybody else.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter vi</hi>. (<hi rend="i">Sulphur Bottom</hi>).&#x2014;An-<lb/>
other retiring gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got<lb/>
by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder<lb/>
divings. He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen him<lb/>
except in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too<lb/>
great a distance to study his countenance. He is never chased;<lb/>
he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are told<lb/>
of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that<lb/>
is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.</p>
<pb xml:id="n191" n="154"/>
<p>Thus ends BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), and now begins BOOK II.<lb/>
(<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>).</p>
<p>OCTAVOES.<note xml:id="fn3-154"><p>Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very<lb/>
plain. Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those<lb/>
of the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them<lb/>
in figure, yet the bookbinder&#x0027;s Quarto volume in its diminished form does<lb/>
not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.</p></note> These embrace the whales of middling<lb/>
magnitude, among which at present may be numbered:&#x2014;I.,<lb/>
the <hi rend="i">Grampus</hi>; II., the <hi rend="i">Black Fish</hi>; III., the <hi rend="i">Narwhale</hi>; IV.,<lb/>
the <hi rend="i">Thrasher</hi>; V., the <hi rend="i">Killer.</hi></p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter i</hi>. (<hi rend="i">Grampus</hi>).&#x2014;Though this<lb/>
fish, whose loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has<lb/>
furnished a proverb to landsmen, is so well known a denizen of<lb/>
the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among whales. But<lb/>
possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan,<lb/>
most naturalists have recognised him for one. He is of mode-<lb/>
rate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in<lb/>
length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He<lb/>
swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is<lb/>
considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some<lb/>
fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the ad-<lb/>
vance of the great sperm whale.</p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter ii</hi>. (<hi rend="i">Black Fish</hi>).&#x2014;I give the<lb/>
popular fishermen&#x0027;s names for all these fish, for generally they<lb/>
are the best. Where any name happens to be vague or inex-<lb/>
pressive, I shall say so, and suggest another. I do so now,<lb/>
touching the Black Fish, so called, because blackness is the rule<lb/>
among almost all whales. So, call him the Hyena Whale, if<lb/>
you please. His voracity is well known, and from the circum-<lb/>
stance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he<lb/>
carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This<lb/>
whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is<lb/>
found in almost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of show-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n192" n="155"/>
ing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks something<lb/>
like a Roman nose. When not more profitably employed, the<lb/>
sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to<lb/>
keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment&#x2014;as<lb/>
some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite<lb/>
alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous<lb/>
wax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales<lb/>
will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.</p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter iii</hi>. (<hi rend="i">Narwhale</hi>), that is, <hi rend="i">Nos-<lb/>
tril whale.</hi>&#x2014;Another instance of a curiously named whale, so<lb/>
named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mis-<lb/>
taken for a peaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in<lb/>
length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed<lb/>
ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn<lb/>
is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a<lb/>
little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the<lb/>
sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something<lb/>
analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What<lb/>
precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be<lb/>
hard to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the<lb/>
sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the<lb/>
Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of<lb/>
the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-<lb/>
piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea,<lb/>
and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so<lb/>
breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises<lb/>
to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided<lb/>
horn may really be used by the Narwhale&#x2014;however that may<lb/>
be&#x2014;it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in<lb/>
reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the<lb/>
Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He<lb/>
is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in<lb/>
almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain clois-<lb/>
tered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn&#x0027;s<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n193" n="156"/>
horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against<lb/>
poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.<lb/>
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same<lb/>
way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into<lb/>
hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of<lb/>
great curiosity. Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher<lb/>
on his return from that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly<lb/>
wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of Greenwich<lb/>
Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; &#x201C;when Sir<lb/>
Martin returned from that voyage,&#x201D; saith Black Letter, &#x201C;on<lb/>
bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long<lb/>
horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the<lb/>
castle at Windsor.&#x201D; An Irish author avers that the Earl of Lei-<lb/>
cester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her highness<lb/>
another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.</p>
<p>The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being<lb/>
of a milk-white ground color, dotted with round and oblong<lb/>
spots of black. His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but<lb/>
there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly<lb/>
found in the circumpolar seas.</p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> IV. (<hi rend="i">Killer</hi>).&#x2014;Of this whale<lb/>
little is precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all<lb/>
to the professed naturalist. From what I have seen of him at<lb/>
a distance, I should say that he was about the bigness of a<lb/>
grampus. He is very savage&#x2014;a sort of Feegee fish. He some-<lb/>
times takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and hangs there<lb/>
like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death. The<lb/>
Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.<lb/>
Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale,<lb/>
on the ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on<lb/>
land and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.</p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> V. (<hi rend="i">Thrasher</hi>).&#x2014;This gentle-<lb/>
man is famous for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing<lb/>
his foes. He mounts the Folio whale&#x0027;s back, and as he swims,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n194" n="157"/>
he works his passage by flogging him; as some schoolmasters<lb/>
get along in the world by a similar process. Still less is known<lb/>
of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in<lb/>
the lawless seas.</p>
<p>Thus ends BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), and begins BOOK III.<lb/>
(<hi rend="i">Duodecimo.</hi>)</p>
<p>DUODECIMOES.&#x2014;These include the smaller whales. I.<lb/>
The Huzza Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The<lb/>
Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.</p>
<p>To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject,<lb/>
it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding<lb/>
four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES&#x2014;a<lb/>
word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of<lb/>
hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes<lb/>
are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a<lb/>
whale is&#x2014;i. e a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail.</p>
<p>BOOK III. (<hi rend="i">Duodecimo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> I. (<hi rend="i">Huzza Porpoise</hi>).&#x2014;<lb/>
This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe.<lb/>
The name is of my own bestowal; for there are more than one<lb/>
sort of porpoises, and something must be done to distinguish<lb/>
them. I call him thus, because he always swims in hilarious<lb/>
shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to<lb/>
heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance<lb/>
is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine<lb/>
spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to wind-<lb/>
ward. They are the lads that always live before the wind.<lb/>
They are accounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can with-<lb/>
stand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish, then heaven<lb/>
help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye. A<lb/>
well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon<lb/>
of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his<lb/>
jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among jewellers<lb/>
and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise<lb/>
meat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n195" n="158"/>
to you that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small<lb/>
that it is not very readily discernible. But the next time you<lb/>
have a chance, watch him; and you will then see the great<lb/>
Sperm whale himself in miniature.</p>
<p>BOOK III. (<hi rend="i">Duodecimo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> II. (<hi rend="i">Algerine Porpoise</hi>).<lb/>
A pirate. Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the<lb/>
Pacific. He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but<lb/>
much of the same general make. Provoke him, and he will<lb/>
buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but<lb/>
never yet saw him captured.</p>
<p>BOOK III. (<hi rend="i">Duodecimo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> III. (<hi rend="i">Mealy-mouthed<lb/>
Porpoise</hi>).&#x2014;The largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in<lb/>
the Pacific, so far as it is known. The only English name, by<lb/>
which he has hitherto been designated, is that of the fishers&#x2014;<lb/>
Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly<lb/>
found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in<lb/>
some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund<lb/>
and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-<lb/>
like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises<lb/>
have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a<lb/>
hazel hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire<lb/>
back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary<lb/>
line, distinct as the mark in a ship&#x0027;s hull, called the &#x201C;bright<lb/>
waist,&#x201D; that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two sepa-<lb/>
rate colors, black above and white below. The white comprises<lb/>
part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes<lb/>
him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a<lb/>
meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much<lb/>
like that of the common porpoise.</p>
<p>&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;</p>
<p>Beyond the <hi rend="sc">Duodecimo</hi>, this system does not proceed, inas-<lb/>
much as the Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you<lb/>
have all the Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of un-<lb/>
certain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an American<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n196" n="159"/>
whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally. I shall<lb/>
enumerate them by their forecastle appellations; for possibly<lb/>
such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may<lb/>
complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following<lb/>
whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can read-<lb/>
ily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Oc-<lb/>
tavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:&#x2014;The Bottle-Nose Whale; the<lb/>
Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale;<lb/>
the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale;<lb/>
the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg<lb/>
Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; &#x0026;c. From Ice-<lb/>
landic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted<lb/>
other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of un-<lb/>
couth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can<lb/>
hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathan-<lb/>
ism, but signifying nothing.</p>
<p>Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would<lb/>
not be here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly<lb/>
see that I have kept my word. But I now leave my cetological<lb/>
System standing thus unfinished, even as the great Cathedral<lb/>
of Cologne was left, with the crane still standing upon the top<lb/>
of the uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished<lb/>
by their first architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the<lb/>
copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever completing<lb/>
anything. This whole book is but a draught&#x2014;nay, but the<lb/>
draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the specksynder</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Concerning</hi> the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good<lb/>
a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n197" n="160"/>
board arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of offi-<lb/>
cers, a class unknown of course in any other marine than the<lb/>
whale-fleet.</p>
<p>The large importance attached to the harpooneer&#x0027;s vocation is<lb/>
evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery,<lb/>
two centuries and more ago, the command of a whale ship was<lb/>
not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain, but was<lb/>
divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder.<lb/>
Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time<lb/>
made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the<lb/>
captain&#x0027;s authority was restricted to the navigation and general<lb/>
management of the vessel: while over the whale-hunting de-<lb/>
partment and all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief Har-<lb/>
pooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery,<lb/>
under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official<lb/>
is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At<lb/>
present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is<lb/>
but one of the captain&#x0027;s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless,<lb/>
as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a<lb/>
whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American<lb/>
Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but un-<lb/>
der certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground)<lb/>
the command of the ship&#x0027;s deck is also his; therefore the grand<lb/>
political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally<lb/>
live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way<lb/>
distinguished as their professional superior; though always, by<lb/>
them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.</p>
<p>Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at<lb/>
sea, is this&#x2014;the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in<lb/>
whale-ships and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quar-<lb/>
ters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the American<lb/>
whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship.<lb/>
That is to say, they take their meals in the captain&#x0027;s cabin, and<lb/>
sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it.</p>
<pb xml:id="n198" n="161"/>
<p>Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far<lb/>
the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man), the<lb/>
peculiar perils of it, and the community of interest prevailing<lb/>
among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for their<lb/>
profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck,<lb/>
together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work;<lb/>
though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less<lb/>
rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never<lb/>
mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whale-<lb/>
men may, in some primitive instances, live together; for all<lb/>
that, the punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are<lb/>
seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance done away. In-<lb/>
deed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the<lb/>
skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not<lb/>
surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much<lb/>
outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the<lb/>
shabbiest of pilot-cloth.</p>
<p>And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was<lb/>
the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and<lb/>
though the only homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instan-<lb/>
taneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the<lb/>
shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and<lb/>
though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances<lb/>
connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed<lb/>
them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or <hi rend="i">in terrorem</hi>,<lb/>
or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means<lb/>
unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.</p>
<p>Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that be-<lb/>
hind those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked<lb/>
himself; incidentally making use of them for other and more<lb/>
private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve.<lb/>
That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a<lb/>
good degree remained unmanifested; through those forms that<lb/>
same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n199" n="162"/>
For be a man&#x0027;s intellectual superiority what it will, it can never<lb/>
assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, with-<lb/>
out the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments,<lb/>
always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is,<lb/>
that for ever keeps God&#x0027;s true princes of the Empire from the<lb/>
world&#x0027;s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air<lb/>
can give, to those men who become famous more through their<lb/>
infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine<lb/>
Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead<lb/>
level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small<lb/>
things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in<lb/>
some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have impart-<lb/>
ed potency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar,<lb/>
the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial<lb/>
brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tre-<lb/>
mendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who<lb/>
would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and di-<lb/>
rect swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his<lb/>
art, as the one now alluded to.</p>
<p>But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nan-<lb/>
tucket grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching<lb/>
Emperors and Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do<lb/>
with a poor old whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all out-<lb/>
ward majestical trappings and housings are denied me. Oh,<lb/>
Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked<lb/>
at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and featured in the<lb/>
unbodied air!</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d34" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXXIV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the cabin-table</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his<lb/>
pale loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n200" n="163"/>
to his lord and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has<lb/>
just been taking an observation of the sun; and is now mutely<lb/>
reckoning the latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet,<lb/>
reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory<lb/>
leg. From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would<lb/>
think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But pre-<lb/>
sently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself<lb/>
to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying,<lb/>
&#x201C;Dinner, Mr. Starbuck,&#x201D; disappears into the cabin.</p>
<p>When the last echo of his sultan&#x0027;s step has died away, and<lb/>
Starbuck, the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he<lb/>
is seated, then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few<lb/>
turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle,<lb/>
says, with some touch of pleasantness, &#x201C;Dinner, Mr. Stubb,&#x201D;<lb/>
and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges about the<lb/>
rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see<lb/>
whether it be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes<lb/>
up the old burden, and with a rapid &#x201C;Dinner, Mr. Flask,&#x201D; fol-<lb/>
lows after his predecessors.</p>
<p>But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the<lb/>
quarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint;<lb/>
for, tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions,<lb/>
and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless<lb/>
squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk&#x0027;s head; and<lb/>
then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizen-<lb/>
top for a shelf, he goes down rollicking, so far at least as he<lb/>
remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions,<lb/>
by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into the<lb/>
cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether,<lb/>
and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
presence, in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.</p>
<p>It is not the least among the strange things bred by the<lb/>
intense artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air<lb/>
of the deck some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n201" n="164"/>
boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander; yet,<lb/>
ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to<lb/>
their customary dinner in that same commander&#x0027;s cabin, and<lb/>
straightway their inoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble<lb/>
air towards him, as he sits at the head of the table; this is mar-<lb/>
vellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this difference? A<lb/>
problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of<lb/>
Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but cour-<lb/>
teously, therein certainly must have been some touch of mun-<lb/>
dane grandeur. But he who in the rightly regal and intelli-<lb/>
gent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table of invited<lb/>
guests, that man&#x0027;s unchallenged power and dominion of indivi-<lb/>
dual influence for the time; that man&#x0027;s royalty of state<lb/>
transcends Belshazzar&#x0027;s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.<lb/>
Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to<lb/>
be C&#x00E6;sar. It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no<lb/>
withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you superadd the<lb/>
official supremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will<lb/>
derive the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.</p>
<p>Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute,<lb/>
maned sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his war-<lb/>
like but still deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each<lb/>
officer waited to be served. They were as little children before<lb/>
Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest<lb/>
social arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened<lb/>
upon the old man&#x0027;s knife, as he carved the chief dish before<lb/>
him. I do not suppose that for the world they would have pro-<lb/>
faned that moment with the slightest observation, even upon so<lb/>
neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out<lb/>
his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked,<lb/>
Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck&#x0027;s plate towards him, the<lb/>
mate received his meat as though receiving alms; and cut it<lb/>
tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed<lb/>
against the plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n202" n="165"/>
not without circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet<lb/>
at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly dines with<lb/>
the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were somehow<lb/>
solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab<lb/>
forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a<lb/>
relief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket<lb/>
in the hold below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest<lb/>
son, and little boy of this weary family party. His were the shin-<lb/>
bones of the saline beef; his would have been the drumsticks.<lb/>
For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must have seemed<lb/>
to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had he<lb/>
helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have<lb/>
been able to hold his head up in this honest world; neverthe-<lb/>
less, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask<lb/>
helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much<lb/>
as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself<lb/>
to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied<lb/>
it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion;<lb/>
or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such<lb/>
marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was<lb/>
not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a<lb/>
butterless man!</p>
<p>Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the din-<lb/>
ner, and Flask is the first man up. Consider! For hereby<lb/>
Flask&#x0027;s dinner was badly jammed in point of time. Starbuck<lb/>
and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they also have<lb/>
the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is<lb/>
but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small<lb/>
appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast,<lb/>
then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than three<lb/>
mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to<lb/>
precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once<lb/>
admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity<lb/>
of an officer, from that moment he had never known what<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n203" n="166"/>
it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what<lb/>
he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immor-<lb/>
tal in him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have<lb/>
for ever departed from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how<lb/>
I wish I could fist a bit of old-fashioned beef in the forecastle,<lb/>
as I used to when I was before the mast. There&#x0027;s the fruits of<lb/>
promotion now; there&#x0027;s the vanity of glory: there&#x0027;s the<lb/>
insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of<lb/>
the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask&#x0027;s official capa-<lb/>
city, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample<lb/>
vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at<lb/>
Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfound-<lb/>
ered before awful Ahab.</p>
<p>Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called<lb/>
the first table in the Pequod&#x0027;s cabin. After their departure,<lb/>
taking place in inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth<lb/>
was cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried order by<lb/>
the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers were<lb/>
bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees. They<lb/>
made a sort of temporary servants&#x0027; hall of the high and mighty<lb/>
cabin.</p>
<p>In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and<lb/>
nameless invisible domineerings of the captain&#x0027;s table, was the<lb/>
entire care-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy<lb/>
of those inferior fellows the harpooneers. While their masters,<lb/>
the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their<lb/>
own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food with such a<lb/>
relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;<lb/>
they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with<lb/>
spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and<lb/>
Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous<lb/>
repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great<lb/>
baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.<lb/>
And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with a nim-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n204" n="167"/>
ble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly<lb/>
way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-<lb/>
wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor,<lb/>
assisted Dough-Boy&#x0027;s memory by snatching him up bodily, and<lb/>
thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher, while<lb/>
Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle prelimi-<lb/>
nary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,<lb/>
shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the<lb/>
progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what<lb/>
with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the<lb/>
periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-<lb/>
Boy&#x0027;s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly,<lb/>
after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they<lb/>
demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little<lb/>
pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through<lb/>
the blinds of its door, till all was over.</p>
<p>It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego,<lb/>
opposing his filed teeth to the Indian&#x0027;s: crosswise to them,<lb/>
Daggoo seated on the floor, for a bench would have brought<lb/>
his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every motion<lb/>
of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake,<lb/>
as when an African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for<lb/>
all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to say<lb/>
dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively<lb/>
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through<lb/>
so broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this<lb/>
noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding ele-<lb/>
ment of air; and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sub-<lb/>
lime life of the worlds. Not by beef or by bread, are giants<lb/>
made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric<lb/>
smack of the lip in eating&#x2014;an ugly sound enough&#x2014;so much<lb/>
so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether<lb/>
any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when<lb/>
he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n205" n="168"/>
that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted Steward all<lb/>
but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by<lb/>
his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the<lb/>
harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their lances and other<lb/>
weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they would<lb/>
ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not<lb/>
at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he for-<lb/>
get that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly<lb/>
have been guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.<lb/>
Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white waiter who waits upon<lb/>
cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a<lb/>
buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three<lb/>
salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-<lb/>
mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every<lb/>
step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.</p>
<p>But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nomi-<lb/>
nally lived there; still, being anything but sedentary in their<lb/>
habits, they were scarcely ever in it except at meal-times, and<lb/>
just before sleeping-time, when they passed through it to their<lb/>
own peculiar quarters.</p>
<p>In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most Ame-<lb/>
rican whale captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion<lb/>
that by rights the ship&#x0027;s cabin belongs to them; and that<lb/>
it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any time, per-<lb/>
mitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers<lb/>
of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out<lb/>
of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was<lb/>
something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for<lb/>
a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent<lb/>
thing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby;<lb/>
in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inac-<lb/>
cessible. Though nominally included in the census of Christen-<lb/>
dom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the world, as the<lb/>
last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as when<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n206" n="169"/>
Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the<lb/>
woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the<lb/>
winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling<lb/>
old age, Ahab&#x0027;s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body,<lb/>
there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the mast-head</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation<lb/>
with the other seamen my first mast-head came round.</p>
<p>In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned al-<lb/>
most simultaneously with the vessel&#x0027;s leaving her port; even<lb/>
though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail<lb/>
ere reaching her proper cruising ground. And if, after a three,<lb/>
four, or five years&#x0027; voyage she is drawing nigh home with any-<lb/>
thing empty in her&#x2014;say, an empty vial even&#x2014;then, her mast-<lb/>
heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-<lb/>
poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether<lb/>
relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.</p>
<p>Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat,<lb/>
is a very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure ex-<lb/>
patiate here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads<lb/>
were the old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find<lb/>
none prior to them. For though their progenitors, the builders<lb/>
of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear<lb/>
the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the<lb/>
final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may<lb/>
be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God&#x0027;s<lb/>
wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority<lb/>
over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n207" n="170"/>
mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general<lb/>
belief among arch&#x00E6;ologists, that the first pyramids were founded<lb/>
for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the<lb/>
peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices;<lb/>
whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old<lb/>
astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for<lb/>
new stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for<lb/>
a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the<lb/>
famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him a lofty<lb/>
stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of<lb/>
his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a<lb/>
tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless<lb/>
stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place<lb/>
by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing every-<lb/>
thing out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern<lb/>
standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone,<lb/>
iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a<lb/>
stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing<lb/>
out upon discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon;<lb/>
who, upon the top of the column of Vendome, stands with arms<lb/>
folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air; careless, now,<lb/>
who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe, Louis<lb/>
Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high<lb/>
aloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of<lb/>
Hercules&#x0027; pillars, his column marks that point of human gran-<lb/>
deur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also,<lb/>
on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar<lb/>
Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,<lb/>
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there<lb/>
is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor<lb/>
Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below,<lb/>
however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the dis-<lb/>
tracted decks upon which they gaze; however it may be sur-<lb/>
mised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n208" n="171"/>
future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be<lb/>
shunned.</p>
<p>It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the<lb/>
mast-head standers of the land with those of the sea; but that<lb/>
in truth it is not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which<lb/>
Obed Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket, stands accountable.<lb/>
The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale<lb/>
fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game,<lb/>
the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea-coast,<lb/>
to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,<lb/>
something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years<lb/>
ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New<lb/>
Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the<lb/>
ready-manned boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now<lb/>
become obsolete; turn we then to the one proper mast-head,<lb/>
that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are kept<lb/>
manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regu-<lb/>
lar turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two<lb/>
hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly<lb/>
pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is<lb/>
delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent<lb/>
decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantie<lb/>
stilts, while beneath you and between your legs, as it were,<lb/>
swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even as ships once sailed<lb/>
between the boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes. There<lb/>
you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with nothing<lb/>
ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the<lb/>
drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor.<lb/>
For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime unevent-<lb/>
fulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras<lb/>
with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into<lb/>
unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions;<lb/>
bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the<lb/>
thought of what you shall have for dinner&#x2014;for all your meals<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n209" n="172"/>
for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and your<lb/>
bill of fare is immutable.</p>
<p>In one of those southern whalemen, on a long three or four<lb/>
years&#x0027; voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours<lb/>
you spend at the mast-head would amount to several entire<lb/>
months. And it is much to be deplored that the place to which<lb/>
you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your<lb/>
natural life, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching<lb/>
to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable<lb/>
localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock, a<lb/>
hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those<lb/>
small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate<lb/>
themselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of the<lb/>
t&#x0027; gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks<lb/>
(almost peculiar to whalemen) called the t&#x0027; gallant cross-trees.<lb/>
Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner feels about as<lb/>
cosy as he would standing on a bull&#x0027;s horns. To be sure, in<lb/>
cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the<lb/>
shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest<lb/>
watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as<lb/>
the soul is glued inside of its fleshly tabernacle, and cannot freely<lb/>
move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running<lb/>
great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the<lb/>
snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house<lb/>
as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You<lb/>
cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no<lb/>
more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.</p>
<p>Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-<lb/>
heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those envi-<lb/>
able little tents or pulpits, called <hi rend="i">crow&#x0027;s-nests</hi>, in which the look-<lb/>
outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement<lb/>
weather of the frozen seas. In the fire-side narrative of Captain<lb/>
Sleet, entitled &#x201C;A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the<lb/>
Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n210" n="173"/>
Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;&#x201D; in this admirable<lb/>
volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charm-<lb/>
ingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented <hi rend="i">crow&#x0027;s-<lb/>
nest</hi> of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet&#x0027;s good<lb/>
craft. He called it the <hi rend="i">Sleet&#x0027;s crow&#x0027;s-nest</hi>, in honor of himself;<lb/>
he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all<lb/>
ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own<lb/>
children after our own names (we fathers being the original<lb/>
inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after<lb/>
ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the<lb/>
Sleet&#x0027;s crow&#x0027;s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is<lb/>
open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable<lb/>
side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.<lb/>
Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it<lb/>
through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or<lb/>
side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a<lb/>
locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In<lb/>
front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet,<lb/>
pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain<lb/>
Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow&#x0027;s nest of his, he<lb/>
tells us that he always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the<lb/>
rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for the purpose of<lb/>
popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns infest-<lb/>
ing those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from<lb/>
the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down<lb/>
upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a<lb/>
labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the<lb/>
little detailed conveniences of his crow&#x0027;s-nest; but though he so<lb/>
enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a<lb/>
very scientific account of his experiments in this crow&#x0027;s-nest<lb/>
with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counter-<lb/>
acting the errors resulting from what is called the &#x201C;local attrac-<lb/>
tion&#x201D; of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal<lb/>
vicinity of the iron in the ship&#x0027;s planks, and in the Glacier&#x0027;s<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n211" n="174"/>
case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down black-<lb/>
smiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very<lb/>
discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned &#x201C;binnacle<lb/>
deviations,&#x201D; &#x201C;azimuth compass observations,&#x201D; and &#x201C;approxi-<lb/>
mate errors,&#x201D; he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was<lb/>
not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations,<lb/>
as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well reple-<lb/>
nished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his<lb/>
crow&#x0027;s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the<lb/>
whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and<lb/>
learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he should<lb/>
so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and<lb/>
comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and<lb/>
hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in<lb/>
that bird&#x0027;s nest within three or four perches of the pole.</p>
<p>But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed<lb/>
aloft as Captain Sleet and his Greenland-men were; yet that<lb/>
disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrast-<lb/>
ing serenity of those seductive seas in which we South fishers<lb/>
mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging very<lb/>
leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or<lb/>
any one else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending<lb/>
a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail<lb/>
yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at<lb/>
last mount to my ultimate destination.</p>
<p>Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit<lb/>
that I kept but sorry guard. With the problem of the<lb/>
universe revolving in me, how could I&#x2014;being left completely to<lb/>
myself at such a thought-engendering altitude,&#x2014;how could I<lb/>
but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships&#x0027;<lb/>
standing orders, &#x201C;Keep your weather eye open, and sing out<lb/>
every time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-<lb/>
owners of Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n212" n="175"/>
fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye; given to un-<lb/>
seasonable meditativeness; and who offers to ship with the<lb/>
Ph&#x00E6;don instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of such an<lb/>
one, I say: your whales must be seen before they can be killed;<lb/>
and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten<lb/>
wakes round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm<lb/>
the richer. Nor are these monitions at all unneeded. For now-<lb/>
adays, the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many<lb/>
romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded young men, disgusted<lb/>
with the carking cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar<lb/>
and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself<lb/>
upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,<lb/>
and in moody phrase ejaculates:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!</p>
<p>Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-<lb/>
minded young philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not<lb/>
feeling sufficient &#x201C;interest&#x201D; in the voyage; half-hinting that<lb/>
they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition, as that in<lb/>
their secret souls they would rather not see whales than other-<lb/>
wise. But all in vain; those young Platonists have a notion<lb/>
that their vision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use,<lb/>
then, to strain the visual nerve? They have left their opera-<lb/>
glasses at home.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, thou monkey,&#x201D; said a harpooneer to one of these<lb/>
lads, &#x201C;we&#x0027;ve been cruising now hard upon three years,<lb/>
and thou hast not raised a whale yet. Whales are scarce<lb/>
as hen&#x0027;s teeth whenever thou art up here.&#x201D; Perhaps they<lb/>
were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the<lb/>
far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of<lb/>
vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the<lb/>
blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses<lb/>
his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n213" n="176"/>
image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind<lb/>
and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing<lb/>
that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some<lb/>
undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of those<lb/>
elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting<lb/>
through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to<lb/>
whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;<lb/>
like Cranmer&#x0027;s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last<lb/>
a part of every shore the round globe over.</p>
<p>There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life impart-<lb/>
ed by a gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea;<lb/>
by the sea, from the inscrutable tides of God. But while this<lb/>
sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand an inch,<lb/>
slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror.<lb/>
Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day,<lb/>
in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you drop<lb/>
through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to<lb/>
rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXVI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the quarter-deck</hi>
(<hi rend="i">Enter Ahab: Then, all.</hi>).</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one<lb/>
morning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended<lb/>
the cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually<lb/>
walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal,<lb/>
take a few turns in the garden.</p>
<p>Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced<lb/>
his old rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they<lb/>
were all over dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n214" n="177"/>
mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed<lb/>
and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger foot-<lb/>
prints&#x2014;the foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.</p>
<p>But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even<lb/>
as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so<lb/>
full of his thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that<lb/>
he made, now at the main-mast and now at the binnacle, you<lb/>
could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and<lb/>
pace in him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed,<lb/>
that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer move-<lb/>
ment.</p>
<p>&#x201C;D&#x0027;ye mark him, Flask?&#x201D; whispered Stubb; &#x201C;the chick<lb/>
that&#x0027;s in him pecks the shell. T&#x0027;will soon be out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The hours wore on;&#x2014;Ahab now shut up within his cabin;<lb/>
anon, pacing the deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose<lb/>
in his aspect.</p>
<p>It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt<lb/>
by the bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole<lb/>
there, and with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Star-<lb/>
buck to send everybody aft.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir!&#x201D; said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never<lb/>
given on ship-board except in some extraordinary case.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Send everybody aft,&#x201D; repeated Ahab. &#x201C;Mast-heads, there!<lb/>
come down!&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the entire ship&#x0027;s company were assembled, and with<lb/>
curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him,<lb/>
for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is<lb/>
coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks,<lb/>
and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his stand-<lb/>
point; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his<lb/>
heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched<lb/>
hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whisper-<lb/>
ing among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,<lb/>
that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n215" n="178"/>
witnessing a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Ve-<lb/>
hemently pausing, he cried:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sing out for him!&#x201D; was the impulsive rejoinder from a score<lb/>
of clubbed voices.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good!&#x201D; cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; ob-<lb/>
serving the hearty animation into which his unexpected question<lb/>
had so magnetically thrown them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And what do ye next, men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lower away, and after him!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And what tune is it ye pull to, men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;A dead whale or a stove boat!&#x201D;</p>
<p>More, and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving,<lb/>
grew the countenance of the old man at every shout; while the<lb/>
mariners began to gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling<lb/>
how it was that they themselves became so excited at such<lb/>
seemingly purposeless questions.</p>
<p>But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolv-<lb/>
ing in his pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud,<lb/>
and tightly, almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them<lb/>
thus:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders<lb/>
about a white whale. Look ye! d&#x0027;ye see this Spanish ounce<lb/>
of gold?&#x201D;&#x2014;holding up a broad bright coin to the sun&#x2014;&#x201C;it is<lb/>
a sixteen dollar piece, men. D&#x0027;ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand<lb/>
me yon top-maul.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without<lb/>
speaking, was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts<lb/>
of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre, and without using any<lb/>
words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a<lb/>
sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the<lb/>
mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.</p>
<p>Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards<lb/>
the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, ex-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n216" n="179"/>
hibiting the gold with the other, and with a high raised voice<lb/>
exclaiming: &#x201C;Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale<lb/>
with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye<lb/>
raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in<lb/>
his starboard fluke&#x2014;look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that<lb/>
same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Huzza! huzza!&#x201D; cried the seamen, as with swinging tar-<lb/>
paulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x0027;s a white whale, I say,&#x201D; resumed Ahab, as he threw down<lb/>
the top-maul; &#x201C;a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men;<lb/>
look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked<lb/>
on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest,<lb/>
and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they<lb/>
had started as if each was separately touched by some specific<lb/>
recollection.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab,&#x201D; said Tashtego, &#x201C;that white whale must be<lb/>
the same that some call Moby Dick.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Moby Dick?&#x201D; shouted Ahab. &#x201C;Do ye know the white<lb/>
whale then, Tash?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?&#x201D;<lb/>
said the Gay-Header deliberately.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And has he a curious spout, too,&#x201D; said Daggoo, &#x201C;very<lb/>
bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And he have one, two, tree&#x2014;oh! good many iron in him<lb/>
hide, too, Captain,&#x201D; cried Queequeg disjointedly, &#x201C;all twiske-<lb/>
tee be-twisk, like him&#x2014;him&#x2014;&#x201D; faltering hard for a word, and<lb/>
screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bot-<lb/>
tle&#x2014;&#x201C;like him&#x2014;him&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Corkscrew!&#x201D; cried Ahab, &#x201C;aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie<lb/>
all twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a<lb/>
big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our<lb/>
Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing; aye,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n217" n="180"/>
Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall. Death<lb/>
and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen&#x2014;Moby Dick<lb/>
&#x2014;Moby Dick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab,&#x201D; said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask,<lb/>
had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing sur-<lb/>
prise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat<lb/>
explained all the wonder. &#x201C;Captain Ahab, I have heard of<lb/>
Moby Dick&#x2014;but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who told thee that?&#x201D; cried Ahab; then pausing, &#x201C;Aye,<lb/>
Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick tha<lb/>
dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump<lb/>
I stand on now. Aye, aye,&#x201D; he shouted with a terrific, loud, ani-<lb/>
mal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; &#x201C;Aye, aye! it was<lb/>
that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor pegging<lb/>
lubber of me for ever and a day!&#x201D; Then tossing both arms, with<lb/>
measureless imprecations he shouted out: &#x201C;Aye, aye! and I&#x0027;ll<lb/>
chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round<lb/>
the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition&#x0027;s flames before I<lb/>
give him up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to<lb/>
chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides<lb/>
of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say<lb/>
ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look<lb/>
brave.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye!&#x201D; shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running<lb/>
closer to the excited old man: &#x201C;A sharp eye for the White<lb/>
Whale; a sharp lance for Moby Dick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;God bless ye,&#x201D; he seemed to half sob and half shout.</p>
<p>&#x201C;God bless ye, men. Steward! go draw the great measure of<lb/>
grog. But what&#x0027;s this long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt<lb/>
thou not chase the white whale? art not game for Moby<lb/>
Dick?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death<lb/>
too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business<lb/>
we follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my command-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n218" n="181"/>
er&#x0027;s vengeance. How many barrels will thy vengeance yield<lb/>
thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will not fetch thee<lb/>
much in our Nantucket market.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck;<lb/>
thou requirest a little lower layer. If money&#x0027;s to be the<lb/>
measurer, man, and the accountants have computed their great<lb/>
counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas, one to<lb/>
every three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee, that my<lb/>
vengeance will fetch a great premium <hi rend="i">here!</hi>&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He smites his chest,&#x201D; whispered Stubb, &#x201C;what&#x0027;s that for?<lb/>
methinks it rings most vast, but hollow.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Vengeance on a dumb brute!&#x201D; cried Starbuck, &#x201C;that simply<lb/>
smote thee from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged<lb/>
with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hark ye yet again,&#x2014;the little lower layer. All visible ob-<lb/>
jects, man, are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event&#x2014;<lb/>
in the living act, the undoubted deed&#x2014;there, some unknown<lb/>
but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features<lb/>
from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike<lb/>
through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except<lb/>
by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is<lb/>
that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there&#x0027;s<lb/>
naught beyond. But &#x0027;tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me;<lb/>
I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice<lb/>
sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and<lb/>
be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will<lb/>
wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,<lb/>
man; I&#x0027;d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do<lb/>
that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair<lb/>
play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my<lb/>
master, man, is even that fair play. Who&#x0027;s over me? Truth<lb/>
hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than<lb/>
fiends&#x0027; glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and<lb/>
palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye.</p>
<pb xml:id="n219" n="182"/>
<p>Starbuck, what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There<lb/>
are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I meant<lb/>
not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish<lb/>
cheeks of spotted tawn&#x2014;living, breathing pictures painted by<lb/>
the sun. The Pagan leopards&#x2014;the unrecking and unwor-<lb/>
shipping things, that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the<lb/>
torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are they<lb/>
not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See<lb/>
Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it.<lb/>
Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one tost sapling can-<lb/>
not, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. &#x0027;Tis but to help<lb/>
strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more?<lb/>
From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all<lb/>
Nantucket, surely he will not hang back, when every foremast-<lb/>
hand has clutched a whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee;<lb/>
I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak!&#x2014;Aye, aye! thy<lb/>
silence, then, <hi rend="i">that</hi> voices thee. (<hi rend="i">Aside</hi>) Something shot from<lb/>
my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck<lb/>
now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;God keep me!&#x2014;keep us all!&#x201D; murmured Starbuck, lowly.</p>
<p>But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the<lb/>
mate, Ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the<lb/>
low laugh from the hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of<lb/>
the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of the sails<lb/>
against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in. For<lb/>
again Starbuck&#x0027;s downeast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness<lb/>
of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on;<lb/>
the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as before. Ah,<lb/>
ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?<lb/>
But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet<lb/>
not so much predictions from without, as verifications of the<lb/>
foregoing things within. For with little external to constrain<lb/>
us, the innermost necessities in our being, these still drive us on.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The measure! the measure!&#x201D; cried Ahab.</p>
<pb xml:id="n220" n="183"/>
<p>Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the har-<lb/>
pooneers, he ordered them to produce their weapons. Then<lb/>
ranging them before him near the capstan, with their harpoons<lb/>
in their hands, while his three mates stood at his side with their<lb/>
lances, and the rest of the ship&#x0027;s company formed a circle round<lb/>
the group; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every<lb/>
man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot<lb/>
eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he<lb/>
rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but, alas!<lb/>
only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Drink and pass!&#x201D; he cried, handing the heavy charged<lb/>
flagon to the nearest seaman. &#x201C;The crew alone now drink.<lb/>
Round with it, round! Short draughts&#x2014;long swallows, men;<lb/>
&#x0027;tis hot as Satan&#x0027;s hoof. So, so; it goes round excellently. It<lb/>
spiralizes in ye; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye. Well<lb/>
done; almost drained. That way it went, this way it comes.<lb/>
Hand it me&#x2014;here&#x0027;s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so<lb/>
brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this<lb/>
capstan; and ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye<lb/>
harpooneers, stand there with your irons; and ye, stout mari-<lb/>
ners, ring me in, that I may in some sort revive a noble custom<lb/>
of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will yet see<lb/>
that&#x2014; Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.<lb/>
Hand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again,<lb/>
wer&#x0027;t not thou St. Vitus&#x0027; imp&#x2014;away, thou ague!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me.<lb/>
Well done! Let me touch the axis.&#x201D; So saying, with extended<lb/>
arm, he grasped the three level, radiating lances at their crossed<lb/>
centre; while so doing, suddenly and nervously twitched them;<lb/>
meanwhile, glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from<lb/>
Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some nameless,<lb/>
interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the same<lb/>
fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n221" n="184"/>
magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sus-<lb/>
tained, and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways<lb/>
from him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In vain!&#x201D; cried Ahab; &#x201C;but, maybe, &#x0027;tis well. For did ye<lb/>
three but once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric<lb/>
thing, <hi rend="i">that</hi> had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too,<lb/>
it would have dropped ye dead. Perchance ye need it not.<lb/>
Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye three cup-<lb/>
bearers to my three pagan kinsmen there&#x2014;yon three most<lb/>
honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers.<lb/>
Disdain the task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet<lb/>
of beggars, using his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals!<lb/>
your own condescension, <hi rend="i">that</hi> shall bend ye to it. I do not<lb/>
order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye<lb/>
harpooneers!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood<lb/>
with the detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet<lb/>
long, held, barbs up, before him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them<lb/>
over! know ye not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So,<lb/>
so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. The irons! take them; hold<lb/>
them while I fill!&#x201D; Forthwith, slowly going from one officer<lb/>
to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery<lb/>
waters from the pewter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous<lb/>
chalices! Bestow them, ye who are now made parties to this<lb/>
indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck! but the deed is done!<lb/>
Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it. Drink, ye har-<lb/>
pooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful<lb/>
whaleboat&#x0027;s bow&#x2014;Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if<lb/>
we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!&#x201D; The long, barbed<lb/>
steel goblets were lifted; and to cries and maledictions against<lb/>
the white whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down<lb/>
with a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered. Once<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n222" n="185"/>
more, and finally, the replenished pewter went the rounds<lb/>
among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to them,<lb/>
they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.</p>

<p>Yonder, by the ever-brimming goblet&#x0027;s rim, the warm waves<lb/>
blush like wine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver<lb/>
sun&#x2014;slow dived from noon,&#x2014;goes down; my soul mounts up!<lb/>
she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then, the crown too<lb/>
heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it<lb/>
bright with many a gem; I, the wearer, see not its far flash-<lb/>
ings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly con-<lb/>
founds. &#x0027;Tis iron&#x2014;that I know&#x2014;not gold. &#x0027;Tis split, too&#x2014;<lb/>
that I feel; the jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to<lb/>
beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort<lb/>
that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!</p>
<p>Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the<lb/>
sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more.<lb/>
This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to<lb/>
me, since I can ne&#x0027;er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I<lb/>
lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and<lb/>
most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good<lb/>
night&#x2014;good night! (<hi rend="i">waving his hand, he moves from the<lb/>
window.</hi>)</p>
<pb xml:id="n223" n="186"/>
<p>&#x0027;Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at<lb/>
the least; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various<lb/>
wheels, and they revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills<lb/>
of powder, they all stand before me; and I their match. Oh,<lb/>
hard! that to fire others, the match itself must needs be<lb/>
wasting! What I&#x0027;ve dared, I&#x0027;ve willed; and what I&#x0027;ve willed,<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll do! They think me mad&#x2014;Starbuck does; but I&#x0027;m<lb/>
demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that&#x0027;s<lb/>
only calm to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I<lb/>
should be dismembered; and&#x2014;Aye! I lost this leg. I now<lb/>
prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer. Now, then,<lb/>
be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That&#x0027;s more than ye, ye<lb/>

<head>CHAPTER XLI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">moby dick</hi>.</head>
<p>I, ISHMAEL, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up<lb/>
with the rest; my oath had been welded with theirs; and<lb/>
stronger I shouted, and more did I hammer and clinch my oath,<lb/>
because of the dread in my soul. A wild, mystical, sympathetic-<lb/>
cal feeling was in me; Ahab&#x0027;s quenchless feud seemed mine.<lb/>
With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous<lb/>
monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths<lb/>
of violence and revenge.</p>
<p>For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompa-<lb/>
nied, secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas<lb/>
mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all<lb/>
of them knew of his existence; only a few of them, compara-<lb/>
tively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet<lb/>
had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small in-<lb/>
deed. For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the<lb/>
disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery cir-<lb/>
cumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest<lb/>
along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole<lb/>
twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-<lb/>
telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate<lb/>
voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all<lb/>
these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long ob-<lb/>
structed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet<lb/>
of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It<lb/>
was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have<lb/>
encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meri-<lb/>
dian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n234" n="197"/>
which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had<lb/>
completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair<lb/>
presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no<lb/>
other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale<lb/>
fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances<lb/>
of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked;<lb/>
therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave<lb/>
battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part,<lb/>
were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it<lb/>
were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to<lb/>
the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous<lb/>
encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popu-<lb/>
larly regarded.</p>
<p>And as for those who, previously hearing of the White<lb/>
Whale, by chance caught sight of him; in the beginning of the<lb/>
thing they had every one of them, almost, as boldly and fear-<lb/>
lessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of that species.<lb/>
But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults&#x2014;not<lb/>
restricted to sprained wrists and ancles, broken limbs, or<lb/>
devouring amputations&#x2014;but fatal to the last degree of fatality;<lb/>
those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling<lb/>
their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to<lb/>
shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of<lb/>
the White Whale had eventually come.</p>
<p>Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still<lb/>
the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters.<lb/>
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very<lb/>
body of all surprising terrible events,&#x2014;as the smitten tree gives<lb/>
birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in that<lb/>
of terra firma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any ade-<lb/>
quate reality for them to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the<lb/>
land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses every other<lb/>
sort of maritime life, in the wondorfulness and fearfulness of the<lb/>
rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n235" n="198"/>
whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and su-<lb/>
perstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they<lb/>
are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with<lb/>
whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they<lb/>
not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle<lb/>
to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you<lb/>
sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you<lb/>
would not come to any chiselled hearthstone, or aught hospital-<lb/>
ble beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and longi-<lb/>
tudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is<lb/>
wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant<lb/>
with many a mighty birth.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere<lb/>
transit over the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of<lb/>
the White Whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all<lb/>
manner of morbid hints, and half-formed f&#x0153;tal suggestions of<lb/>
supernatural agencies, which eventually invested Moby Dick<lb/>
with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears.<lb/>
So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that<lb/>
few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White<lb/>
Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils<lb/>
of his jaw.</p>
<p>But there were still other and more vital practical influences<lb/>
at work. Not even at the present day has the original prestige<lb/>
of the Sperm Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other<lb/>
species of the leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen<lb/>
as a body. There are those this day among them, who, though<lb/>
intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the<lb/>
Greenland or Right whale, would perhaps&#x2014;either from profes-<lb/>
sional inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity, decline a con-<lb/>
test with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are plenty of<lb/>
whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing<lb/>
under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered<lb/>
the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n236" n="199"/>
restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the<lb/>
North; seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a<lb/>
childish fire-side interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of<lb/>
Southern whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of<lb/>
the great Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended,<lb/>
than on board of those prows which stem him.</p>
<p>And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former<lb/>
legendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find some<lb/>
book naturalists&#x2014;Olassen and Povelson&#x2014;declaring the Sperm<lb/>
Whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in<lb/>
the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to<lb/>
be athirst for human blood. Nor even down to so late a time<lb/>
as Cuvier&#x0027;s, were these or almost similar impressions effaced.<lb/>
For in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms that at<lb/>
sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks included) are &#x201C;struck<lb/>
with the most lively terrors,&#x201D; and &#x201C;often in the precipitancy of<lb/>
their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence<lb/>
as to cause instantaneous death.&#x201D; And however the general ex-<lb/>
periences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet<lb/>
in their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povel-<lb/>
son, the superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of<lb/>
their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.</p>
<p>So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning<lb/>
him, not a few of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby<lb/>
Dick, the earlier days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was<lb/>
oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right whalemen to<lb/>
embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare; such<lb/>
men protesting that although other leviathans might be hope-<lb/>
fully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an appari-<lb/>
tion as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to<lb/>
attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity.<lb/>
On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may<lb/>
be consulted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n237" n="200"/>
things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater<lb/>
number who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely,<lb/>
without the specific details of any certain calamity, and without<lb/>
superstitious accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee<lb/>
from the battle if offered.</p>
<p>One of the wild suggestings referred to, as at last coming to<lb/>
be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the super-<lb/>
stitiously inclined, was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick<lb/>
was ubiquitous; that he had actually been encountered in<lb/>
opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.</p>
<p>Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this con-<lb/>
ceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious proba-<lb/>
bility. For as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never<lb/>
yet been divulged, even to the most erudite research; so the<lb/>
hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface re-<lb/>
main, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from<lb/>
time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory<lb/>
speculations regarding them, especially concerning the mystic<lb/>
modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports<lb/>
himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant<lb/>
points.</p>
<p>It is a thing well known to both American and English<lb/>
whale-ships, and as well a thing placed upon authoritative<lb/>
record years ago by Scoresby, that some whales have been<lb/>
captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been<lb/>
found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor<lb/>
is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been<lb/>
declared that the interval of time between the two assaults<lb/>
could not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference,<lb/>
it has been believed by some whalemen, that the Nor&#x0027; West<lb/>
Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to the<lb/>
whale. So that here, in the real living experience of living<lb/>
men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello<lb/>
mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n238" n="201"/>
lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface);<lb/>
and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain<lb/>
near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the<lb/>
Holy Land by an underground passage); these fabulous nar-<lb/>
rations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whale-<lb/>
man.</p>
<p>Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these;<lb/>
and knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White<lb/>
Whale had escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise<lb/>
that some whalemen should go still further in their supersti-<lb/>
tions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal<lb/>
(for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of<lb/>
spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still swim away<lb/>
unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick<lb/>
blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again<lb/>
in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsul-<lb/>
lied jet would once more be seen.</p>
<p>But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was<lb/>
enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the<lb/>
monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power. For,<lb/>
it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distin-<lb/>
guished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere<lb/>
thrown out&#x2014;a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a<lb/>
high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent<lb/>
features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted<lb/>
seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who<lb/>
knew him.</p>
<p>The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and<lb/>
marbled with the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he<lb/>
had gained his distinctive appellation of the White Whale; a<lb/>
name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when seen<lb/>
gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-<lb/>
way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings.</p>
<p>Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n239" n="202"/>
liue, nor yet his deformed lower jaw, that so much invested<lb/>
the whale with natural terror, as that unexampled, intelligent<lb/>
malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had over<lb/>
and over again evinced in his assaults. More than all, his<lb/>
treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught<lb/>
else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with<lb/>
every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been<lb/>
known to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them,<lb/>
either stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in con-<lb/>
sternation to their ship.</p>
<p>Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though<lb/>
similar disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no<lb/>
means unusual in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such<lb/>
seemed the White Whale&#x0027;s infernal aforethought of ferocity, that<lb/>
every dismembering or death that he caused, was not wholly<lb/>
regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.</p>
<p>Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the<lb/>
minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid<lb/>
the chips of chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn com-<lb/>
rades, they swam out of the white curds of the whale&#x0027;s direful<lb/>
wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as<lb/>
if at a birth or a bridal.</p>
<p>His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both<lb/>
whirling in the eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from<lb/>
his broken prow, had dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas<lb/>
duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach<lb/>
the fathom-deep life of the whale. That captain was Ahab.<lb/>
And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped<lb/>
lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned<lb/>
Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with<lb/>
more seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt,<lb/>
then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter, Ahab had<lb/>
cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n240" n="203"/>
fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to<lb/>
identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his in-<lb/>
tellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam<lb/>
before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those mali-<lb/>
cious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till<lb/>
they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung. That<lb/>
intangible malignity which has been from the beginning; to<lb/>
whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of<lb/>
the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced<lb/>
in their statue devil;&#x2014;Ahab did not fall down and worship it<lb/>
like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred<lb/>
white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All<lb/>
that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of<lb/>
things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews<lb/>
and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and<lb/>
thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and<lb/>
made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate<lb/>
felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his<lb/>
chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart&#x0027;s shell upon it.</p>
<p>It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant<lb/>
rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then,<lb/>
in darting at the monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose<lb/>
to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and when he<lb/>
received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt the ago-<lb/>
nizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this<lb/>
collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of<lb/>
days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in<lb/>
one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling<lb/>
Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed<lb/>
soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad.<lb/>
That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the en-<lb/>
counter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but<lb/>
certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n241" n="204"/>
was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such<lb/>
vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was more-<lb/>
over intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to<lb/>
lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock.<lb/>
In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales.<lb/>
And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship,<lb/>
with mild stun&#x0027;sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics,<lb/>
and, to all appearances, the old man&#x0027;s delirium seemed left<lb/>
behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth<lb/>
from his dark den into the blessed light and air; even then,<lb/>
when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued<lb/>
his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the<lb/>
direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden<lb/>
self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and<lb/>
most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but<lb/>
become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab&#x0027;s full<lb/>
lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the una-<lb/>
bated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but<lb/>
unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his<lb/>
narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab&#x0027;s broad mad-<lb/>
ness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one<lb/>
jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before<lb/>
living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a<lb/>
furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general<lb/>
sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon<lb/>
its own mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength,<lb/>
Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold more<lb/>
potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object.</p>
<p>This is much; yet Ahab&#x0027;s larger, darker, deeper part remains<lb/>
unhinted. But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is<lb/>
profound. Winding far down from within the very heart of<lb/>
this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand&#x2014;however grand<lb/>
and wonderful, now quit it;&#x2014;and take your way, ye nobler,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n242" n="205"/>
sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far<lb/>
beneath the fantastic towers of man&#x0027;s upper earth, his root of<lb/>
grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an<lb/>
antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So<lb/>
with a broken throne, the great gods mock that captive king;<lb/>
so like a Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen<lb/>
brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye down there, ye<lb/>
prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad king! A<lb/>
family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royal-<lb/>
ties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret<lb/>
come.</p>
<p>Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely:<lb/>
all my means are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet<lb/>
without power to kill, or change, or shun the fact; he likewise<lb/>
knew that to mankind he did long dissemble; in some sort, did<lb/>
still. But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to<lb/>
his perceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless, so<lb/>
well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory<lb/>
leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him other-<lb/>
wise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the<lb/>
terrible casualty which had overtaken him.</p>
<p>The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise<lb/>
popularly ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the<lb/>
added moodiness which always afterwards, to the very day of<lb/>
sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on<lb/>
his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting<lb/>
his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account of such dark<lb/>
symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent isle were in-<lb/>
clined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he was<lb/>
all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full of<lb/>
rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed<lb/>
within and scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting<lb/>
fangs of some incurable idea; such an one, could he be found,<lb/>
would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n243" n="206"/>
against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason<lb/>
thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one<lb/>
would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his<lb/>
underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,<lb/>
that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and<lb/>
keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voy-<lb/>
age with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the<lb/>
White Whale. Had any one of his old acquaintances on shore<lb/>
but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then, how soon<lb/>
would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship<lb/>
from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises,<lb/>
the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He<lb/>
was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural re-<lb/>
venge.</p>
<p>Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing<lb/>
with curses a Job&#x0027;s whale round the world, at the head of a<lb/>
crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and casta-<lb/>
ways, and cannibals&#x2014;morally enfeebled also, by the income-<lb/>
petence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Star-<lb/>
buck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness<lb/>
in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew,<lb/>
so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infer-<lb/>
nal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it<lb/>
was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man&#x0027;s ire&#x2014;-<lb/>
by what evil magic their souls were possessed, that at times his<lb/>
hate seemed almost theirs; the White Whale as much their in-<lb/>
sufferable foe as his; how all this came to be&#x2014;what the White<lb/>
Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious understandings,<lb/>
also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the<lb/>
gliding great demon of the seas of life,&#x2014;all this to explain,<lb/>
would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean<lb/>
miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his<lb/>
shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who<lb/>
does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n244" n="207"/>
a seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to<lb/>
the abandonment of the time and the place; but while yet<lb/>
all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute<lb/>
but the deadliest ill.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the whiteness of the whale</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">What</hi> the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what,<lb/>
at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.</p>
<p>Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby<lb/>
Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man&#x0027;s<lb/>
soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague,<lb/>
nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity<lb/>
completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and<lb/>
well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in<lb/>
a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that<lb/>
above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain<lb/>
myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain my-<lb/>
self I must, else all these chapters might be naught.</p>
<p>Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly en-<lb/>
hances beauty, as if imparting some special virtue of its own,<lb/>
as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls; and though various<lb/>
nations have in some way recognised a certain royal pre-eminence<lb/>
in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing<lb/>
the title &#x201C;Lord of the White Elephants&#x201D; above all their other<lb/>
magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings<lb/>
of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal<lb/>
standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a<lb/>
snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, C&#x00E6;sarian,<lb/>
heir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial color the<lb/>
same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence in it applies<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n245" n="208"/>
to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership<lb/>
over every dusky tribe; and though, besides all this, whiteness<lb/>
has been even made significant of gladness, for among the<lb/>
Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in<lb/>
other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is<lb/>
made the emblem of many touching, noble things&#x2014;the inno-<lb/>
cence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the Red<lb/>
Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was<lb/>
the deepest pledge of honor; though in many climes, whiteness<lb/>
typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge, and<lb/>
contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by<lb/>
milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the<lb/>
most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine<lb/>
spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the<lb/>
white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar; and in<lb/>
the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being made incar-<lb/>
nate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois,<lb/>
the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the<lb/>
holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful creature<lb/>
being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit<lb/>
with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though<lb/>
directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests de-<lb/>
rive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or<lb/>
tunic, worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy<lb/>
pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed in the<lb/>
celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though in the Vision<lb/>
of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the<lb/>
four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great<lb/>
white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like<lb/>
wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with whatever<lb/>
is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an elusive<lb/>
something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes<lb/>
more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in<lb/>
blood.</p>
<pb xml:id="n246" n="209"/>
<p>This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of white-<lb/>
ness, when divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled<lb/>
with any object terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the<lb/>
furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the poles, and the<lb/>
white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky white-<lb/>
ness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That<lb/>
ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mild-<lb/>
ness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb gloating<lb/>
of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his<lb/>
heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear<lb/>
or shark.<note xml:id="fn4-209"><p>With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him<lb/>
who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the white-<lb/>
ness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of<lb/>
that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said,<lb/>
only arises from the circumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of<lb/>
the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love;<lb/>
and hence, by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds,<lb/>
the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But even as-<lb/>
suming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would<lb/>
not have that intensified terror.</p></note></p>
<p>Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of<lb/>
spiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which that white<lb/>
phantom sails in all imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw<lb/>
that spell; but God&#x0027;s great, unflattering laureate, Nature.<note xml:id="fn5-209"><p>I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged<lb/>
gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch<lb/>
below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the<lb/>
main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and<lb/>
with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast<lb/>
archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings<lb/>
and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as<lb/>
some king&#x0027;s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible,<lb/>
strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As<lb/>
Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so<lb/>
white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the<lb/>
miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed<lb/>
at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that<lb/>
darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor<lb/>
what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! I never had heard<lb/>
that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly un-<lb/>
known to men ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney<lb/>
was some seaman&#x0027;s name for albatross. So that by no possibility could<lb/>
Coleridge&#x0027;s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical im-<lb/>
pressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon our deck. For<lb/>
neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross.<lb/>
Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble<lb/>
merit of the poem and the poet.</p></note></p>
<p>As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that<lb/>
creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the<lb/>
same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly<lb/>
hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish<lb/>
mass for the dead begins with &#x201C;Requiem eternam&#x201D; (eternal rest), whence<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Requiem</hi> denominating the mass itself, and any other funereal music.<lb/>
Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and<lb/>
the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him <hi rend="i">Requin.</hi></p>
<p>I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly<lb/>
lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a<lb/>
solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I<lb/>
have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the<lb/>
Antarctic fowl.</p>
<p>But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I<lb/>
will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the<lb/>
sea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered,<lb/>
leathern tally round its neck, with the ship&#x0027;s time and place; and then<lb/>
letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man,<lb/>
was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-fold-<lb/>
ing, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!</p>
<pb xml:id="n247" n="210"/>
<p>Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is<lb/>
that of the White Steed of the Praries; a magnificent milk-<lb/>
white charger, large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with<lb/>
the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning<lb/>
carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild<lb/>
horses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n248" n="211"/>
Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head<lb/>
he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every even-<lb/>
ing leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his<lb/>
mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings<lb/>
more resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have fur-<lb/>
nished him. A most imperial and archangelical apparition of<lb/>
that unfallen, western world, which to the eyes of the old trap-<lb/>
pers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times<lb/>
when Adam walked majestic as a god, bluff-bowed and fearless<lb/>
as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid his aides and<lb/>
marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed<lb/>
it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his circumambi-<lb/>
ent subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White<lb/>
Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening<lb/>
through his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented<lb/>
himself, always to the bravest Indians he was the object of<lb/>
trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be questioned from<lb/>
what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that it was<lb/>
his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with di-<lb/>
vineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though<lb/>
commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain name-<lb/>
less terror.</p>
<p>But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all<lb/>
that accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White<lb/>
Steed and Albatross.</p>
<p>What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and<lb/>
often shocks the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his<lb/>
own kith and kin! It is that whiteness which invests him, a<lb/>
thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino is as well<lb/>
made as other men&#x2014;has no substantive deformity&#x2014;and yet<lb/>
this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more<lb/>
strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this<lb/>
be so?</p>
<pb xml:id="n249" n="212"/>
<p>Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable<lb/>
but not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her<lb/>
forces this crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy<lb/>
aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been<lb/>
denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some historic in-<lb/>
stances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an aux-<lb/>
iliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in<lb/>
Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction,<lb/>
the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the<lb/>
market-place!</p>
<p>Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience<lb/>
of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of<lb/>
this hue. It cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quail-<lb/>
ty in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer, is the<lb/>
marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as<lb/>
much like the badge of consternation in the other world, as of<lb/>
mortal trepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we<lb/>
borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them.<lb/>
Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same<lb/>
snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-<lb/>
white fog&#x2014;Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that<lb/>
even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist,<lb/>
rides on his pallid horse.</p>
<p>Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or<lb/>
gracious thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in<lb/>
its profoundest idealized significance it calls up a peculiar appari-<lb/>
tion to the soul.</p>
<p>But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal<lb/>
man to account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible.<lb/>
Can we, then, by the citation of some of those instances where-<lb/>
in this thing of whiteness&#x2014;though for the time either wholly<lb/>
or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to<lb/>
impart to it aught fearful, but, nevertheless, is found to exert<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n250" n="213"/>
over us the same sorcery, however modified;&#x2014;can we thus<lb/>
hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hid-<lb/>
den cause we seek?</p>
<p>Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to<lb/>
subtlety, and without imagination no man can follow another<lb/>
into these halls. And though, doubtless, some at least of the<lb/>
imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been<lb/>
shared by most men, yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of<lb/>
them at the time, and therefore may not be able to recall them<lb/>
now.</p>
<p>Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be<lb/>
but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day,<lb/>
does the bare mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such<lb/>
long, dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims,<lb/>
down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread,<lb/>
unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States, why<lb/>
does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun,<lb/>
evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?</p>
<p>Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned war-<lb/>
riors and kings (which will not wholly account for it) that<lb/>
makes the White Tower of London tell so much more strongly<lb/>
on the imagination of an untravelled American, than those other<lb/>
storied structures, its neighbors&#x2014;the Byward Tower, or even the<lb/>
Bloody? And those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of<lb/>
New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic<lb/>
ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name<lb/>
while the thought of Virginia&#x0027;s Blue Ridge is full of a soft, dewy,<lb/>
distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and<lb/>
longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a spec-<lb/>
tralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us<lb/>
with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the<lb/>
waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or,<lb/>
to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the<lb/>
fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n251" n="214"/>
&#x201C;the tall pale man&#x201D; of the Hartz forests, whose changeless<lb/>
pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves&#x2014;why<lb/>
is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the<lb/>
Blocksburg?</p>
<p>Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-<lb/>
toppling earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas:<lb/>
nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight<lb/>
of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and<lb/>
crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and<lb/>
her suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other,<lb/>
as a tossed pack of cards;&#x2014;it is not these things alone which<lb/>
make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city thou can&#x0027;st see.<lb/>
For Lima has taken the white veil; and there is a higher horror<lb/>
in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness<lb/>
keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful<lb/>
greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ram-<lb/>
parts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own<lb/>
distortions.</p>
<p>I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon<lb/>
of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exag-<lb/>
gerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible; nor to the un-<lb/>
imaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances<lb/>
whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this<lb/>
one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form at<lb/>
all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean by<lb/>
these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by<lb/>
the following examples.</p>
<p>First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign<lb/>
lands, if by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigi-<lb/>
lance, and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his<lb/>
faculties; but under precisely similar circumstances, let him be<lb/>
called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a<lb/>
midnight sea of milky whiteness&#x2014;as if from encircling head-<lb/>
lands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n252" n="215"/>
then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom<lb/>
of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in<lb/>
vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and<lb/>
helm they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under<lb/>
him again. Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, &#x201C;Sir,<lb/>
it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear<lb/>
of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of<lb/>
the snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except,<lb/>
perhaps, in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness<lb/>
reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit of what<lb/>
a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman soli-<lb/>
tudes. Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the<lb/>
West, who with comparative indifference views an unbounded<lb/>
prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig to<lb/>
break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, behold-<lb/>
ing the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some<lb/>
infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he,<lb/>
shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking<lb/>
hope and solace to his misery, views what seems a boundless<lb/>
church-yard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and<lb/>
splintered crosses.</p>
<p>But thou sayest, methinks this white-lead chapter about<lb/>
whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou<lb/>
surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.</p>
<p>Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some<lb/>
peaceful valley of Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey&#x2014;-<lb/>
why is it that upon the sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh<lb/>
buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see it, but<lb/>
only smells its wild animal muskiness&#x2014;why will he start, snort,<lb/>
and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright?<lb/>
There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild crea-<lb/>
tures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness<lb/>
he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the ex-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n253" n="216"/>
perience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England<lb/>
colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?</p>
<p>No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the in-<lb/>
stinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though<lb/>
thousands of miles from Oregon, still when he smells that savage<lb/>
musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as present as to the<lb/>
deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they may<lb/>
be trampling into dust.</p>
<p>Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak<lb/>
rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate<lb/>
shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael,<lb/>
are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!</p>
<p>Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which<lb/>
the mystic sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the<lb/>
colt, somewhere those things must exist. Though in many of<lb/>
its aspects this visible world seems formed in love, the invisible<lb/>
spheres were formed in fright.</p>
<p>But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness,<lb/>
and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and<lb/>
more strange and far more portentous&#x2014;why, as we have seen,<lb/>
it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay,<lb/>
the very veil of the Christian&#x0027;s Deity; and yet should be as it<lb/>
is, the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to man-<lb/>
kind.</p>
<p>Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless<lb/>
voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from<lb/>
behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the<lb/>
white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in essence<lb/>
whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color,<lb/>
and at the same time the concrete of all colors; is it for these<lb/>
reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in<lb/>
a wide landscape of snows&#x2014;a colorless, all-color of atheism<lb/>
from which we shrink? And when we consider that other<lb/>
theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues&#x2014;-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n254" n="217"/>
every stately or lovely emblazoning&#x2014;the sweet tinges of sunset<lb/>
skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the<lb/>
butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits,<lb/>
not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from with-<lb/>
out; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot,<lb/>
whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within;<lb/>
and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical<lb/>
cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great prin-<lb/>
ciple of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if<lb/>
operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects,<lb/>
even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge&#x2014;pondering all<lb/>
this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful<lb/>
travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear colored and coloring<lb/>
glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself<lb/>
blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the pros-<lb/>
pect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale<lb/>
was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery hunt?</p>

<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="sc">Hist</hi>! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were<lb/>
standing in a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water<lb/>
butts in the waist, to the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this<lb/>
manner, they passed the buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Stand-<lb/>
ing, for the most part, on the hallowed precincts of the quarter-<lb/>
deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet. From<lb/>
hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence, only<lb/>
broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of<lb/>
the unceasingly advancing keel.</p>
<pb xml:id="n255" n="218"/>
<p>It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the<lb/>
cordon, whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his<lb/>
neighbor, a Cholo, the words above.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d&#x0027;ye mean?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There it is again&#x2014;under the hatches&#x2014;don&#x0027;t you hear it<lb/>
&#x2014;a cough&#x2014;it sounded like a cough.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There again-there it is!&#x2014;it sounds like two or three<lb/>
sleepers turning over, now!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It&#x0027;s the three<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Say what ye will, shipmate; I&#x0027;ve sharp ears.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, you are the chap, ain&#x0027;t ye, that heard the hum of<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Grin away; we&#x0027;ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco,<lb/>
there is somebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been<lb/>
seen on deck; and I suspect our old Mogul knows something<lb/>
of it too. I heard Stubb tell Flask, one morning watch, that<lb/>
there was something of that sort in the wind.&#x201D;</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLIV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the chart</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Had</hi> you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after<lb/>
the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild<lb/>
ratification of his purpose with his crew, you would have seen<lb/>
him go to a locker in the transom, and bringing out a large<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n256" n="219"/>
wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread them before him<lb/>
on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before it, you<lb/>
would have seen him intently study the various lines and<lb/>
shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady<lb/>
pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were<lb/>
blank. At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books<lb/>
beside him, wherein were set down the seasons and places in<lb/>
which, on various former voyages of various ships, sperm whales<lb/>
had been captured or seen.</p>
<p>While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in<lb/>
chains over his head, continually rocked with the motion of the<lb/>
ship, and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines<lb/>
upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that while he<lb/>
himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled<lb/>
charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses<lb/>
upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.</p>
<p>But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of<lb/>
his cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every<lb/>
night they were brought out; almost every night some pencil<lb/>
marks were effaced, and others were substituted. For with the<lb/>
charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading a<lb/>
maze of currents and eddies, with a view to the more certain<lb/>
accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.</p>
<p>Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the<lb/>
leviathans, it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek<lb/>
out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet.<lb/>
But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides<lb/>
and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s food; and, also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained<lb/>
seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at<lb/>
reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties, concern-<lb/>
ing the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search<lb/>
of his prey.</p>
<p>So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n257" n="220"/>
of the sperm whale&#x0027;s resorting to given waters, that many<lb/>
hunters believe that, could he be closely observed and studied<lb/>
throughout the world; were the logs for one voyage of the entire<lb/>
whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm<lb/>
whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of<lb/>
the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows. On this hint,<lb/>
attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory<lb/>
charts of the sperm whale.<note xml:id="fn6-220"><p>Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by<lb/>
an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National Observa-<lb/>
tory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it appears that<lb/>
precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and portions of it are<lb/>
presented in the circular. &#x201C;This chart divides the ocean into districts of<lb/>
five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude; perpendicularly<lb/>
through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve<lb/>
months; and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines;<lb/>
one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in<lb/>
every district, and the two others to show the number of days in which<lb/>
whales, sperm or right, have been seen.&#x201D;</p></note></p>
<p>Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to<lb/>
another, the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct<lb/>
mdash;say, rather, secret intelligence from the Deity&#x2014;mostly swim in<lb/>
<hi rend="i">veins</hi>, as they are called; continuing their way along a given<lb/>
ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever<lb/>
sailed her course, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous<lb/>
precision. Though, in these cases, the direction taken by any one<lb/>
whale be straight as a surveyor&#x0027;s parallel, and though the line of<lb/>
advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable, straight<lb/>
wake, yet the arbitrary <hi rend="i">vein</hi> in which at these times he<lb/>
is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width<lb/>
(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract);<lb/>
but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone.<lb/>
The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n258" n="221"/>
along that path, migrating whales may with great confidence<lb/>
be looked for.</p>
<p>And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known se-<lb/>
parate feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey;<lb/>
but incrossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds<lb/>
he could, by his art, so place and time himself on his way, as<lb/>
even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.</p>
<p>There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to en-<lb/>
tangle his delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in<lb/>
the reality, perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have<lb/>
their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you<lb/>
cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a<lb/>
latitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identi-<lb/>
cally the same with those that were found there the preceding<lb/>
season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances<lb/>
where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the<lb/>
same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solita-<lb/>
ries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So<lb/>
that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for ex-<lb/>
ample, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian<lb/>
ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not<lb/>
follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any<lb/>
subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter<lb/>
him there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where he<lb/>
had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his<lb/>
casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places<lb/>
of prolonged abode. And where Ahab&#x0027;s chances of ac-<lb/>
complishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion<lb/>
has only been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra<lb/>
prospects were his, ere a particular set time or place were at-<lb/>
tained, when all possibilities would become probabilities, and,<lb/>
as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to a<lb/>
certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined in<lb/>
the one technical phrase&#x2014;the Season-on-the-Line. For there<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n259" n="222"/>
and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been<lb/>
periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the<lb/>
sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any<lb/>
one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the<lb/>
deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there<lb/>
the waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic<lb/>
spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful mo-<lb/>
tive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness<lb/>
and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding<lb/>
soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to<lb/>
rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned,<lb/>
however flattering it might be to those hopes; nor in the sleep-<lb/>
lessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as<lb/>
to postpone all intervening quest.</p>
<p>Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very be-<lb/>
ginning of the Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then<lb/>
could enable her commander to make the great passage south-<lb/>
wards, double Cape Horn, and then running down sixty degrees<lb/>
of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise there.<lb/>
Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the<lb/>
premature hour of the Pequod&#x0027;s sailing had, perhaps, been cor-<lb/>
rectly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of<lb/>
things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five<lb/>
days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of<lb/>
impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous<lb/>
hunt; if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in<lb/>
seas far remote from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn<lb/>
up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal<lb/>
Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by his race.<lb/>
So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades;<lb/>
any wind but the Levanter and Simoom, might blow Moby Dick<lb/>
into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod&#x0027;s circumnavi-<lb/>
gating wake.</p>
<p>But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n260" n="223"/>
seems it not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless<lb/>
ocean, one solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought<lb/>
capable of individual recognition from his hunter, even as a<lb/>
white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constanti<lb/>
ople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick,<lb/>
and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And<lb/>
have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as<lb/>
after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would<lb/>
throw himself back in reveries&#x2014;tallied him, and shall he<lb/>
escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a<lb/>
lost sheep&#x0027;s ear! And here, his mad mind would run on in a<lb/>
breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering<lb/>
came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek<lb/>
to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments<lb/>
does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved re-<lb/>
vengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes<lb/>
with his own bloody nails in his palms.</p>
<p>Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and<lb/>
intolerably vivid dreams of the night, which, resuming his own<lb/>
intense thoughts through the day, carried them on amid a clash-<lb/>
ing of phrensies, and whirled them round and round in his<lb/>
blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became<lb/>
insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the case,<lb/>
these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base,<lb/>
and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames<lb/>
and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to<lb/>
leap down among them; when this hell in himself yawned<lb/>
beneath him, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and<lb/>
with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his state room, as<lb/>
though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these, per-<lb/>
aps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent<lb/>
weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens<lb/>
of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming,<lb/>
unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n261" n="224"/>
that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused<lb/>
him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal,<lb/>
living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time<lb/>
dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times<lb/>
employed it for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously<lb/>
sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic<lb/>
thing, of which, for the time, it was no longer an integral. But<lb/>
as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul, there-<lb/>
ore it must have been that, in Ahab&#x0027;s case, yielding up all his<lb/>
thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose,<lb/>
by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods<lb/>
and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of<lb/>
its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common<lb/>
vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the<lb/>
unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented<lb/>
spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab<lb/>
rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated thing, a<lb/>
formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be sure,<lb/>
but without an object to color, and therefore a blankness in<lb/>
itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a<lb/>
creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus makes<lb/>
him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever;<lb/>
that vulture the very creature he creates.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">So</hi> far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and,<lb/>
indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and<lb/>
curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing<lb/>
chapter, in its earlier part, is as important a one as will be<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n262" n="225"/>
found in this volume; but the leading matter of it requires to<lb/>
be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to<lb/>
be adequately understood, and moreover to take away any in-<lb/>
credulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may<lb/>
induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main<lb/>
points of this affair.</p>
<p>I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but<lb/>
shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate-<lb/>
citations of items, practically or reliably known to me as a<lb/>
whaleman; and from these citations, I take it&#x2014;the conclusion<lb/>
aimed at will naturally follow of itself.</p>
<p>First: I have personally known three instances where a<lb/>
whale, after receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape;<lb/>
and, after an interval (in one instance of three years), has been<lb/>
again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons,<lb/>
both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from<lb/>
the body. In the instance where three years intervened<lb/>
between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may<lb/>
have been something more than that; the man who darted<lb/>
them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a<lb/>
voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party,<lb/>
and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a<lb/>
period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages,<lb/>
tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils inci-<lb/>
dent to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Mean-<lb/>
while, the whale he had struck must also have been on its<lb/>
travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,<lb/>
brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no<lb/>
purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and<lb/>
the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known<lb/>
three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw<lb/>
the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two<lb/>
irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken<lb/>
from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n263" n="226"/>
that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last<lb/>
time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under<lb/>
the whale&#x0027;s eye, which I had observed there three years pre-<lb/>
vious. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than<lb/>
that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally know<lb/>
the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from<lb/>
persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground<lb/>
to impeach.</p>
<p>Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery,<lb/>
however ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have<lb/>
been several memorable historical instances where a particular<lb/>
whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popu-<lb/>
larly cognisable. Why such a whale became thus marked was<lb/>
not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as<lb/>
distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar in that<lb/>
respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his<lb/>
peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a pecu-<lb/>
liarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the<lb/>
fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of<lb/>
perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo<lb/>
Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recog-<lb/>
nise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be<lb/>
discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cul-<lb/>
tivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils<lb/>
ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they make<lb/>
distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they<lb/>
pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary<lb/>
thump for their presumption.</p>
<p>But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great<lb/>
individual celebrity&#x2014;nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown;<lb/>
not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle<lb/>
stories after death, but he was admitted into all the rights, privi-<lb/>
leges, and distinctions of a name; had as much a name indeed as<lb/>
Cambyses or C&#x00E6;sar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n264" n="227"/>
leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long did&#x0027;st lurk in the<lb/>
Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft seen from<lb/>
the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand<lb/>
Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in<lb/>
the vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan!<lb/>
King of Japan, whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the<lb/>
semblance of a snow-white cross against the sky? Was it not<lb/>
so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old<lb/>
tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain<lb/>
prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of<lb/>
Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.</p>
<p>But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after<lb/>
at various times creating great havoc among the boats of dif-<lb/>
ferent vessels, were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted<lb/>
out, chased and killed by valiant whaling captains, who heaved<lb/>
up their anchors with that express object as much in view, as<lb/>
in setting out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain<lb/>
Butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious mur-<lb/>
derous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the Indian<lb/>
King Philip.</p>
<p>I do not know where I can find a better place than just here,<lb/>
to make mention of one or two other things, which to me seem<lb/>
important, as in printed form establishing in all respects the rea<lb/>
sonableness of the whole story of the White Whale, more es-<lb/>
pecially the catastrophe. For this is one of those disheartening<lb/>
instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error.<lb/>
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and<lb/>
most palpable wonders of the world, that without some hints<lb/>
touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the fishery,<lb/>
they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still<lb/>
worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.</p>
<p>First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the<lb/>
general perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a<lb/>
fixed, vivid conception of those perils, and the frequency with<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n265" n="228"/>
which they recur. One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty<lb/>
of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery,<lb/>
ever finds a public record at home, however transient and imme-<lb/>
diately forgotten that record. Do you suppose that that poor<lb/>
fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the whale-<lb/>
line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the<lb/>
bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan&#x2014;do you suppose<lb/>
that that poor fellow&#x0027;s name will appear in the newspaper obi-<lb/>
tuary you will read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because<lb/>
the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea. In<lb/>
fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct<lb/>
or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one<lb/>
particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many<lb/>
others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had<lb/>
had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and<lb/>
three that had each lost a boat&#x0027;s crew. For God&#x0027;s sake, be eco-<lb/>
nomical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn,<lb/>
but at least one drop of man&#x0027;s blood was spilled for it.</p>
<p>Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea<lb/>
that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I<lb/>
have ever found that when narrating to them some specific ex-<lb/>
ample of this two-fold enormousness, they have significantly<lb/>
complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon<lb/>
my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,<lb/>
when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.</p>
<p>But fortunately the special point I here seek can be<lb/>
established upon testimony entirely independent of my own.<lb/>
That point is this: The Sperm Whale is in some cases suffi-<lb/>
ciently powerful, knowing, and judiciously malicious, as with<lb/>
direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and sink a large<lb/>
ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale <hi rend="i">has</hi> done it.</p>
<p>First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of<lb/>
Nantucket, was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she<lb/>
saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n266" n="229"/>
sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were wounded;<lb/>
when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats,<lb/>
issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship.<lb/>
Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that<lb/>
in less than &#x201C;ten minutes&#x201D; she settled down and fell over. Not<lb/>
a surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest<lb/>
exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats.<lb/>
Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed<lb/>
for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods ship-<lb/>
wrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the<lb/>
second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing<lb/>
the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain<lb/>
Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace,<lb/>
who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;<lb/>
I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed<lb/>
with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the<lb/>
catastrophe.<note xml:id="fn7-229"><p>The following are extracts from Chace&#x0027;s narrative: &#x201C;Every fact<lb/>
seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance<lb/>
which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the<lb/>
ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to their<lb/>
direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead,<lb/>
and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to<lb/>
effect which, the exact man&#x0153;uvres which he made were necessary. His<lb/>
aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He<lb/>
came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in which<lb/>
we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge for their suf-<lb/>
ferings.&#x201D; Again: &#x201C;At all events, the whole circumstances taken together,<lb/>
all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the time, impressions<lb/>
in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the part of the whale<lb/>
(many of which impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satis-<lb/>
fied that I am correct in my opinion.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black<lb/>
night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable<lb/>
shore. &#x201C;The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the fears of<lb/>
being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon hidden<lb/>
rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation,<lb/>
seemed scarcely entitled to a moment&#x0027;s thought; the dismal looking<lb/>
wreck, and <hi rend="i">the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale</hi>, wholly engrossed<lb/>
my reflections, until day again made its appearance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In another place&#x2014;p. 45,&#x2014;he speaks of &#x201C;<hi rend="i">the mysterious and mortal<lb/>
attack of the animal.</hi>&#x201D;</p></note></p>
<pb xml:id="n267" n="230"/>
<p>Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the<lb/>
year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the<lb/>
authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced<lb/>
to encounter, though from the whale hunters I have now and<lb/>
then heard casual allusions to it.</p>
<p>Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore<lb/>
J&#x2014;then commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first<lb/>
class, happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains,<lb/>
on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich<lb/>
Islands. Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore<lb/>
was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength<lb/>
ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He<lb/>
peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so smite his<lb/>
stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimble-<lb/>
ful. Very good; but there is more coming. Some weeks<lb/>
after, the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Val-<lb/>
paraiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm<lb/>
whale, that begged a few moments&#x0027; confidential business with<lb/>
him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore<lb/>
apos;s craft such a thwack, that with all his pump going he made<lb/>
straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am<lb/>
not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore&#x0027;s interview with<lb/>
that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted<lb/>
from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale<lb/>
will stand no nonsense.</p>
<pb xml:id="n268" n="231"/>
<p>I will now refer you to Langsdorff&#x0027;s Voyages for a little cir-<lb/>
cumstance in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof.<lb/>
Langsdorff, you must know by the way, was attached to the<lb/>
Russian Admiral Krusenstern&#x0027;s famous Discovery Expedition in<lb/>
the beginning of the present century. Captain Langsdorff thus<lb/>
begins his seventeenth chapter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and<lb/>
the next day we were out in the open sea, on our way to<lb/>
Ochotsh. The weather was very clear and fine, but so intolera-<lb/>
bly cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing. For<lb/>
some days we had very little wind; it was not till the nine-<lb/>
teenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An<lb/>
uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the<lb/>
ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not<lb/>
perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship,<lb/>
which was in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was im-<lb/>
possible to prevent its striking against him. We were thus<lb/>
placed in the most imminent danger, as this gigantic creature,<lb/>
setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out of the<lb/>
water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we<lb/>
who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding<lb/>
that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the<lb/>
monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity.<lb/>
Captain D&#x0027;Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine<lb/>
whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the<lb/>
shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely<lb/>
uninjured.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now, the Captain D&#x0027;Wolf here alluded to as commanding<lb/>
the ship in question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life<lb/>
of unusual adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the<lb/>
village of Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being<lb/>
a nephew of his. I have particularly questioned him concern-<lb/>
ing this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates every word.<lb/>
The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n269" n="232"/>
craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle<lb/>
after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.</p>
<p>In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure,<lb/>
so full, too, of honest wonders&#x2014;the voyage of Lionel Wafer,<lb/>
one of ancient Dampier&#x0027;s old chums&#x2014;I found a little matter<lb/>
set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot<lb/>
forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example, if such be<lb/>
needed.</p>
<p>Lionel, it seems, was on his way to &#x201C;John Ferdinando,&#x201D; as<lb/>
he calls the modern Juan Fernandes. &#x201C;In our way thither,&#x201D; he<lb/>
says, &#x201C;about four o&#x0027;clock in the morning, when we were about<lb/>
one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of America,<lb/>
our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such con-<lb/>
sternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what<lb/>
to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And<lb/>
indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it<lb/>
for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the<lb/>
amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but<lb/>
found no ground. &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their<lb/>
carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their ham-<lb/>
mocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was<lb/>
thrown out of his cabin!&#x201D; Lionel then goes on to impute the<lb/>
shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputa-<lb/>
tion by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that<lb/>
time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land.<lb/>
But I should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early<lb/>
hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by an un-<lb/>
seen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.</p>
<p>I might proceed with several more examples, one way or<lb/>
another known to me, of the great power and malice at times<lb/>
of the sperm whale. In more than one instance, he has been<lb/>
known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships,<lb/>
but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n270" n="233"/>
hurled at him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall<lb/>
can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me<lb/>
say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to<lb/>
a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the<lb/>
ship, and secured there; the whale towing her great hull<lb/>
through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it<lb/>
is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is<lb/>
allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage,<lb/>
as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers;<lb/>
nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character,<lb/>
that upon being attacked he will frequently open his<lb/>
mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecu-<lb/>
tive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and<lb/>
a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant<lb/>
one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most<lb/>
marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the<lb/>
present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels) are mere<lb/>
repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say<lb/>
amen with Solomon&#x2014;Verily there is nothing new under the<lb/>
sun.</p>
<p>In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian<lb/>
magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was<lb/>
Emperor and Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the<lb/>
history of his own times, a work every way of uncommon<lb/>
value. By the best authorities, he has always been considered<lb/>
a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in<lb/>
some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter pre-<lb/>
sently to be mentioned.</p>
<p>Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during<lb/>
the term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster<lb/>
was captured in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora,<lb/>
after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a<lb/>
period of more than fifty years. A fact thus set down in sub-<lb/>
stantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n271" n="234"/>
reason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster<lb/>
was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as<lb/>
for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am<lb/>
strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you<lb/>
why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had<lb/>
been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters<lb/>
connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,<lb/>
and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things,<lb/>
a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investiga-<lb/>
tions have recently proved to me, that in modern times there<lb/>
have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm<lb/>
whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority,<lb/>
that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British<lb/>
navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel<lb/>
of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm<lb/>
whale could, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean<lb/>
into the Propontis.</p>
<p>In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar<lb/>
substance called <hi rend="i">brit</hi> is to be found, the aliment of the right<lb/>
whale. But I have every reason to believe that the food of<lb/>
the sperm whale&#x2014;squid or cuttle-fish&#x2014;lurks at the bottom of<lb/>
that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of<lb/>
that sort, have been found at its surface. If, then, you properly<lb/>
put these statements together, and reason upon them a bit, you<lb/>
will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning,<lb/>
Procopius&#x0027;s sea-monster, that for half a century stove the ships<lb/>
of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm<lb/>
whale.</p>

<hi rend="sc">surmises</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Though</hi>, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in<lb/>
all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate cap-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n272" n="235"/>
ture of Moby Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all<lb/>
mortal interests to that one passion; nevertheless it may have<lb/>
been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded<lb/>
to a fiery whaleman&#x0027;s ways, altogether to abandon the collateral<lb/>
prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if this were otherwise,<lb/>
there were not wanting other motives much more influential<lb/>
with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even con-<lb/>
sidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards<lb/>
the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some<lb/>
degree to all sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew<lb/>
by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each sub-<lb/>
sequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one<lb/>
he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable,<lb/>
there were still additional considerations which, though not so<lb/>
strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet<lb/>
were by no means incapable of swaying him.</p>
<p>To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all<lb/>
tools used in the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get<lb/>
out of order. He knew, for example, that however magnetic his<lb/>
ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck, yet that as-<lb/>
cendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more<lb/>
than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership;<lb/>
for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of<lb/>
corporeal relation. Starbuck&#x0027;s body and Starbuck&#x0027;s coerced will<lb/>
were Ahab&#x0027;s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck&#x0027;s<lb/>
brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul,<lb/>
abhorred his captain&#x0027;s quest, and could he, would joyfully dis-<lb/>
integrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that<lb/>
a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen.<lb/>
During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall<lb/>
into open relapses of rebellion against his captain&#x0027;s leadership,<lb/>
unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were<lb/>
brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle in-<lb/>
sanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more signifi-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n273" n="236"/>
cantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness<lb/>
in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some way<lb/>
be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which natur-<lb/>
ally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept<lb/>
withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men&#x0027;s courage<lb/>
is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action);<lb/>
that when they stood their long night watches, his officers and<lb/>
men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick.<lb/>
For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had<lb/>
hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all<lb/>
sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable&#x2014;they live in<lb/>
the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness&#x2014;and<lb/>
when retained for any object remote and blank in the pur-<lb/>
suit, however promissory of life and passion in the end, it is<lb/>
above all things requisite that temporary interests and employ-<lb/>
ments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for<lb/>
the final dash.</p>
<p>Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of<lb/>
strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations; but such<lb/>
times are evanescent. The permanent constitutional condition<lb/>
of the manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness. Grant-<lb/>
ing that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my<lb/>
savage crew, and playing round their savageness even breeds a cer-<lb/>
tain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of<lb/>
it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for<lb/>
their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted<lb/>
and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre,<lb/>
without committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining<lb/>
other pious perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held<lb/>
to their one final and romantic object&#x2014;that final and romantic<lb/>
object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I will<lb/>
not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash&#x2014;aye,<lb/>
cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some months go by,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n274" n="237"/>
and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this same<lb/>
quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash<lb/>
would soon cashier Ahab.</p>
<p>Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive<lb/>
more related to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is<lb/>
probable, and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime<lb/>
but private purpose of the Pequod&#x0027;s voyage, Ahab was now en-<lb/>
tirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself<lb/>
open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect<lb/>
impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to<lb/>
that end competent, could refuse all further obedience to him,<lb/>
and even violently wrest from him the command. From even<lb/>
the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible<lb/>
consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground,<lb/>
Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself.<lb/>
That protection could only consist in his own predominating<lb/>
brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculat-<lb/>
ing attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was<lb/>
possible for his crew to be subjected to.</p>
<p>For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to<lb/>
be verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still<lb/>
in a good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose<lb/>
of the Pequod&#x0027;s voyage; observe all customary usages; and not<lb/>
only that, but force himself to evince all his well known pas-<lb/>
sionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession.</p>
<p>Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing<lb/>
the three mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright<lb/>
look-out, and not omit reporting even a porpoise. This vigi-<lb/>
lance was not long without reward.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLVII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the mat-maker</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamon were lazily<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n275" n="238"/>
lounging about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-<lb/>
colored waters. Queequeg and I were mildly employed weav-<lb/>
ing what is called a sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our-<lb/>
boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all<lb/>
the scene, and such an incantation of revery lurked in the air,<lb/>
that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible<lb/>
self.</p>
<p>I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the<lb/>
mat. As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of<lb/>
marline between the long yarns of the warp, using my own<lb/>
hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever<lb/>
and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and<lb/>
idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove<lb/>
home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did there then<lb/>
reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the<lb/>
intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this<lb/>
were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanic-<lb/>
ally weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed<lb/>
threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, un-<lb/>
changing vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit<lb/>
of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own.<lb/>
This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own<lb/>
hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into<lb/>
these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg&#x0027;s impulsive, in-<lb/>
different sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or<lb/>
crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by<lb/>
this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding<lb/>
contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this<lb/>
savage&#x0027;s sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions<lb/>
both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance<lb/>
mdash;aye, chance, free will, and necessity&#x2014;no wise incompatible<lb/>
mdash;all interweavingly working together. The straight warp of ne-<lb/>
cessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course&#x2014;its every<lb/>
alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n276" n="239"/>
free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though<lb/>
restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and<lb/>
sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus pre-<lb/>
scribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the<lb/>
last featuring blow at events.</p>
<p>&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;</p>
<p>Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at<lb/>
a sound so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and un-<lb/>
earthly, that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I<lb/>
stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped<lb/>
like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-<lb/>
Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his<lb/>
hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he<lb/>
continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that very<lb/>
moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds<lb/>
of whalemen&#x0027;s look-outs perched as high in the air; but<lb/>
from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have<lb/>
derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the<lb/>
Indian&#x0027;s.</p>
<p>As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so<lb/>
wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have<lb/>
thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of<lb/>
Fate, and by those wild cries announcing their coming.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she<lb/>
blows!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where-away?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!rdquo;<lb/>
Instantly all was commotion.</p>
<p>The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same<lb/>
undeviating and reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen<lb/>
distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There go flukes!&#x201D; was now the cry from Tashtego; and<lb/>
the whales disappeared.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Quick, steward! cried Ahab. &#x201C;Time! time!&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n277" n="240"/>
<p>Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported<lb/>
the exact minute to Ahab.</p>
<p>The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went<lb/>
gently rolling before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had<lb/>
gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them<lb/>
again directly in advance of our bows. For that singular craft<lb/>
at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his<lb/>
head in one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath<lb/>
the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the opposite<lb/>
quarter&#x2014;this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action;<lb/>
for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tash-<lb/>
tego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of<lb/>
our vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers&#x2014;that is,<lb/>
those not appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian<lb/>
at the main-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had<lb/>
come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes<lb/>
were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three boats<lb/>
swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs.<lb/>
Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung<lb/>
to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gun-<lb/>
wale. So look the long line of man-of-war&#x0027;s men about to<lb/>
throw themselves on board an enemy&#x0027;s ship.</p>
<p>But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard<lb/>
that took every eye from the whale. With a start all glared<lb/>
at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms<lb/>
that seemed fresh formed out of air.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d48" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XLVIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the first lowering</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the<lb/>
other side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n278" n="241"/>
casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung<lb/>
there. This boat had always been deemed one of the spare<lb/>
boats, though technically called the captain&#x0027;s, on account of its<lb/>
hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now stood<lb/>
by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly pro-<lb/>
truding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of<lb/>
black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of<lb/>
the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a<lb/>
glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled<lb/>
round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the<lb/>
companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow com-<lb/>
plexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Man-<lb/>
illas;&#x2014;a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and<lb/>
by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies<lb/>
and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their<lb/>
lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.</p>
<p>While yet the wondering ship&#x0027;s company were gazing upon<lb/>
these strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man<lb/>
at their head, &#x201C;All ready there, Fedallah?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ready,&#x201D; was the half-hissed reply.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lower away then; d&#x0027;ye hear?&#x201D; shouting across the deck.<lb/>
&#x201C;Lower away there, I say.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amaze-<lb/>
ment the men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round-<lb/>
in the blocks; with a wallow, the three boats dropped into the<lb/>
sea; while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in<lb/>
any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling<lb/>
ship&#x0027;s side into the tossed boats below.</p>
<p>Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship&#x0027;s lee, when<lb/>
a fourth keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round<lb/>
under the stern, and showed the five strangers rowing Ahab,<lb/>
who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb,<lb/>
and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large ex-<lb/>
panse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n279" n="242"/>
swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats<lb/>
obeyed not the command.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab?&#x2014;&#x201D; said Starbuck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Spread yourselves,&#x201D; cried Ahab; &#x201C;give way, all four boats.<lb/>
Thou, Flask, pull out more to leeward!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, sir,&#x201D; cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping<lb/>
round his great steering oar. &#x201C;Lay back!&#x201D; addressing his crew.<lb/>
&#x201C;There!&#x2014;there!&#x2014;there again! There she blows right ahead,<lb/>
boys!&#x2014;lay back!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, I don&#x0027;t mind &#x0027;em, sir,&#x0027; said Archy; &#x201C;I knew it all<lb/>
before now. Didn&#x0027;t I hear &#x0027;em in the hold? And didn&#x0027;t I tell<lb/>
Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowa-<lb/>
ways, Mr. Flask.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my<lb/>
children; pull, my little ones,&#x201D; drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew<lb/>
some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness. &#x201C;Why don&#x0027;t<lb/>
you break your backbones, my boys? What is it you stare at?<lb/>
Those chaps in yonder boat? What They are only five<lb/>
more hands come to help us&#x2014;never mind from where&#x2014;the<lb/>
more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brim-<lb/>
stone&#x2014;devils are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are-<lb/>
now; that&#x0027;s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that&#x0027;s the stroke<lb/>
to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil,<lb/>
my heroes! Three cheers, men&#x2014;all hearts alive! Easy, easy;<lb/>
don&#x0027;t be in a hurry&#x2014;don&#x0027;t be in a hurry. Why don&#x0027;t you<lb/>
snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So,<lb/>
so, so, then;&#x2014;softly, softly! That&#x0027;s it&#x2014;that&#x0027;s it! long and<lb/>
strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye<lb/>
ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye<lb/>
sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can&#x0027;t ye? pull, won&#x0027;t<lb/>
ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don&#x0027;t ye<lb/>
pull?&#x2014;pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes<lb/>
out! Here!&#x201D; whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n280" n="243"/>
&#x201C;every mother&#x0027;s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the<lb/>
blade between his teeth. That&#x0027;s it&#x2014;that&#x0027;s it. Now ye do<lb/>
something; that looks like it, my steel-bits. Start her&#x2014;start<lb/>
her, my silver-spoons! Start her, marling-spikes!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Stubb&#x0027;s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because<lb/>
he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and<lb/>
especially in inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must<lb/>
not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever<lb/>
flew into downright passions with his congregation. Not at<lb/>
all; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity. He would say<lb/>
the most terrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely com<lb/>
pounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so calculated<lb/>
merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such<lb/>
queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for<lb/>
the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so<lb/>
easy and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steeringoar,<lb/>
and so broadly gaped&#x2014;open-mouthed at times&#x2014;that the<lb/>
mere sight of such a yawning commander, by sheer force of<lb/>
contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb<lb/>
was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is some-<lb/>
times so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their<lb/>
guard in the matter of obeying them.</p>
<p>In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling<lb/>
obliquely across Stubb&#x0027;s bow; and when for a minute or so the<lb/>
two boats were pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the<lb/>
mate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye,<lb/>
sir, if ye please!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Halloa!&#x201D; returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch<lb/>
as he spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew;<lb/>
his face set like a flint from Stubb&#x0027;s.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed.<lb/>
(Strong, strong, boys!&#x201D;) in a whisper to his crew, then speak-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n281" n="244"/>
ing out loud again: &#x201C;A sad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her,<lb/>
seethe her, my lads!) but never mind, Mr. Stubb, all for the<lb/>
best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what will. (Spring,<lb/>
my men, spring!) There&#x0027;s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.<lb/>
Stubb, and that&#x0027;s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm,<lb/>
sperm&#x0027;s the play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand<lb/>
in hand!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, I thought as much,&#x201D; soliloquized Stubb, when<lb/>
the boats diverged, &#x201C;as soon as I clapt eye on &#x0027;em, I thought<lb/>
so. Aye, and that&#x0027;s what he went into the after hold for, so<lb/>
often, as Dough-Boy long suspected. They were hidden down<lb/>
there. The White Whale&#x0027;s at the bottom of it. Well, well,<lb/>
so be it! Can&#x0027;t be helped! All right! Give way, men! It<lb/>
ain&#x0027;t the White Whale to-day! Give way!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a criti-<lb/>
cal instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had<lb/>
not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement<lb/>
in some of the ship&#x0027;s company; but Archy&#x0027;s fancied discovery<lb/>
having some time previous got abroad among them, though<lb/>
indeed not credited then, this had in some small measure pre-<lb/>
pared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge of their<lb/>
wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb&#x0027;s confident way<lb/>
of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed<lb/>
from superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abun-<lb/>
dant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
precise agency in the matter from the beginning. For me, I<lb/>
silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on<lb/>
board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as<lb/>
the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.</p>
<p>Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided<lb/>
the furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other<lb/>
boats; a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling<lb/>
him. Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and<lb/>
whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regu-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n282" n="245"/>
lar strokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along<lb/>
the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi<lb/>
steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer<lb/>
oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his na-<lb/>
ked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale,<lb/>
clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery<lb/>
horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm,<lb/>
like a fencer&#x0027;s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to coun-<lb/>
terbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily ma-<lb/>
naging his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere<lb/>
the White Whale had torn him. All at once the out-<lb/>
stretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,<lb/>
while the boat&#x0027;s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.<lb/>
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three<lb/>
spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had<lb/>
irregularly settled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no dis-<lb/>
tantly discernible token of the movement, though from his closer<lb/>
vicinity Ahab had observed it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Every man look out along his oars!&#x201D; cried Starbuck. &#x201C;Thou,<lb/>
Queequeg, stand up!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow,<lb/>
the savage stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed<lb/>
off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried.<lb/>
Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also<lb/>
triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck him-<lb/>
self was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking<lb/>
tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue<lb/>
eye of the sea.</p>
<p>Not very far distant Flask&#x0027;s boat was also lying breathlessly<lb/>
still; its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the<lb/>
loggerhead, a stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising<lb/>
some two feet above the level of the stern platform. It is used<lb/>
for catching turns with the whale line. Its top is not more<lb/>
spacious than the palm of a man&#x0027;s hand, and standing upon<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n283" n="246"/>
such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of<lb/>
some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little<lb/>
King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-<lb/>
Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this logger-<lb/>
head stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can&#x0027;t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me<lb/>
on to that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to<lb/>
steady his way, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volun-<lb/>
teered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only<lb/>
I wish you fifty feet taller.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite<lb/>
planks of the boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, present-<lb/>
ed his flat palm to Flask&#x0027;s foot, and then putting Flask&#x0027;s hand<lb/>
on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as he him-<lb/>
self should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the little man<lb/>
high and dry on his shoulders. And here was Flask now stand-<lb/>
ing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breast-<lb/>
band to lean against and steady himself by.</p>
<p>At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what<lb/>
wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will main-<lb/>
tain an erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by<lb/>
the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas. Still more<lb/>
strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself,<lb/>
under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask mount-<lb/>
ed upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining<lb/>
himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric ma-<lb/>
jesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled<lb/>
his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a<lb/>
snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though<lb/>
truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now<lb/>
and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n284" n="247"/>
he thereby give to the negro&#x0027;s lordly chest. So have I seen<lb/>
Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth,<lb/>
but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing<lb/>
solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular<lb/>
soundings, not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that<lb/>
were the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was<lb/>
resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe. He<lb/>
withdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant<lb/>
like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed home the loading<lb/>
with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match<lb/>
across the rough sand-paper of his hand, when Tashtego, his<lb/>
harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two<lb/>
fixed stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude<lb/>
to his seat, crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, &#x201C;Down,<lb/>
down all, and give way!&#x2014;there they are!&#x201D;</p>
<p>To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would<lb/>
have been visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit<lb/>
of greenish white water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor<lb/>
hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the<lb/>
confused scud from white rolling billows. The air around<lb/>
suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were, like the air over<lb/>
intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this atmospheric<lb/>
waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of water,<lb/>
also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the<lb/>
other indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their<lb/>
forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.</p>
<p>All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of<lb/>
troubled water and air. But it bade far to outstrip them; it<lb/>
flew on and on, as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down<lb/>
a rapid stream from the hills.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pull, pull, my good boys,&#x201D; said Starbuck, in the lowest<lb/>
possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while<lb/>
the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n285" n="248"/>
the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring<lb/>
binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew, though,<lb/>
nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the silence of the<lb/>
boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar<lb/>
whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.</p>
<p>How different the loud little King-Post. &#x201C;Sing out and say<lb/>
something, my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts!<lb/>
Beach me, beach me on their black backs, boys; only do that<lb/>
for me, and I&#x0027;ll sign over to you my Martha&#x0027;s Vineyard planta-<lb/>
tion, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay me on&#x2014;lay<lb/>
me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad:<lb/>
See! see that white water!&#x201D; And so shouting, he pulled his hat<lb/>
from his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking<lb/>
it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing<lb/>
and plunging in the boat&#x0027;s stern like a crazed colt from the<lb/>
prairie.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look at that chap now,&#x201D; philosophically drawled Stubb,<lb/>
who, with his unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained<lb/>
between his teeth, at a short distance, followed after&#x2014;&#x201C;He&#x0027;s got<lb/>
fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes, give him fits&#x2014;that&#x0027;s the very<lb/>
word&#x2014;pitch fits into &#x0027;em. Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pud-<lb/>
ding for supper, you know;&#x2014;merry&#x0027;s the word. Pull, babes<lb/>
mdash;pull, sucklings&#x2014;pull, all. But what the devil are you hurry-<lb/>
ing about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull,<lb/>
and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones,<lb/>
and bite your knives in two&#x2014;that&#x0027;s all. Take it easy&#x2014;why<lb/>
don&#x0027;t ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and<lb/>
lungs!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-<lb/>
yellow crew of his&#x2014;these were words best omitted here; for<lb/>
you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land. Only<lb/>
the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such<lb/>
words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder, and<lb/>
foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.</p>
<pb xml:id="n286" n="249"/>
<p>Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allu-<lb/>
sions of Flask to &#x201C;that whale,&#x201D; as he called the fictitious<lb/>
monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his<lb/>
boat&#x0027;s bow with its tail&#x2014;these allusions of his were at times<lb/>
so vivid and life-like, that they would cause some one or two of<lb/>
his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder. But this<lb/>
was against all rule; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes,<lb/>
and ram a skewer through their necks; usage pronouncing that<lb/>
they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but arms, in<lb/>
these critical moments.</p>
<p>It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast<lb/>
swells of the omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they<lb/>
made, as they rolled along the eight gunwales, like gigantic<lb/>
bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended agony<lb/>
of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge<lb/>
of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to cut<lb/>
it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and<lb/>
hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the<lb/>
opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other<lb/>
side;&#x2014;all these, with the cries of the headsmen and har-<lb/>
pooneers, and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the<lb/>
wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing down upon her<lb/>
boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her screaming<lb/>
brood;&#x2014;all this was thrilling. Not the raw recruit, marching<lb/>
from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle;<lb/>
not the dead man&#x0027;s ghost encountering the first unknown<lb/>
phantom in the other world;&#x2014;neither of these can feel stranger<lb/>
and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first<lb/>
time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of<lb/>
the hunted sperm whale.</p>
<p>The dancing white water made by the chase was now becom-<lb/>
ing more and more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of<lb/>
the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor<lb/>
no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n287" n="250"/>
whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled<lb/>
more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running<lb/>
dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still<lb/>
rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such mad-<lb/>
ness through the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be<lb/>
worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks.</p>
<p>Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist;<lb/>
neither ship nor boat to be seen.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Give way, men,&#x201D; whispered Starbuck, drawing still further<lb/>
aft the sheet of his sail; &#x201C;there is time to kill a fish yet before<lb/>
the squall comes. There&#x0027;s white water again!&#x2014;close to!<lb/>
Spring!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us<lb/>
denoted that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were<lb/>
they overheard, when with a lightning-like hurtling whisper<lb/>
Starbuck said: &#x201C;Stand up!&#x201D; and Queequeg, harpoon in hand,<lb/>
sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and<lb/>
death peril so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the<lb/>
intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat, they<lb/>
knew that the imminent instant had come; they heard, too, an<lb/>
enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their<lb/>
litter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist,<lb/>
the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests<lb/>
of enraged serpents.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x0027;s his hump. <hi rend="i">There, there</hi>, give it to him!&#x201D; whispered<lb/>
Starbuck.</p>
<p>A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the<lb/>
darted iron of Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion<lb/>
came an invisible push from astern, while forward the boat<lb/>
seemed striking on a ledge; the sail collapsed and exploded; a<lb/>
gush of scalding vapor shot up near by; something rolled and<lb/>
tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew were<lb/>
half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n288" n="251"/>
curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had<lb/>
all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron,<lb/>
escaped.</p>
<p>Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed.<lb/>
Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing<lb/>
them across the gunwale, tumbled back to our places. There<lb/>
we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering every rib<lb/>
and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended<lb/>
craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of<lb/>
the ocean.</p>
<p>The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers<lb/>
together; the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around<lb/>
us like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we<lb/>
were burning; immortal in these jaws of death! In vain we<lb/>
hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the<lb/>
chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm.<lb/>
Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the<lb/>
shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen. The ris-<lb/>
ing sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars<lb/>
were useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-pre-<lb/>
servers. So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg,<lb/>
after many failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the<lb/>
lantern; then stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Quee-<lb/>
queg as the standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then,<lb/>
he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that al-<lb/>
mighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol<lb/>
of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst<lb/>
of despair.</p>
<p>Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of<lb/>
ship or boat, we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The<lb/>
mist still spread over the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in<lb/>
the bottom of the boat. Suddenly Queequeg started to his<lb/>
feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard a faint creak-<lb/>
ing, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n289" n="252"/>
sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly part-<lb/>
ed by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the<lb/>
sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down<lb/>
upon us within a distance of not much more than its length.</p>
<p>Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one<lb/>
instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ship&#x0027;s bows like a chip<lb/>
at the base of a cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it,<lb/>
and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern.<lb/>
Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas, and<lb/>
were at last taken up and safely landed on board. Ere the<lb/>
squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from their<lb/>
fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given<lb/>
us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some<lb/>
token of our perishing,&#x2014;an oar or a lance pole.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XLIX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the hyena</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">There</hi> are certain queer times and occasions in this strange<lb/>
mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe<lb/>
for a vast practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly<lb/>
discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody&#x0027;s<lb/>
expense but his own. However, nothing dispirits, and nothing<lb/>
seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all events, all<lb/>
creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible and<lb/>
invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of potent di-<lb/>
gestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small<lb/>
difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of<lb/>
life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,<lb/>
good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by<lb/>
the unseen and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of way-<lb/>
ward mood I am speaking of, comes over a man only in some<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n290" n="253"/>
time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst of his<lb/>
earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him<lb/>
a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the general<lb/>
joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this<lb/>
free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it<lb/>
I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great<lb/>
White Whale its object.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, when they had dragged me, the last man,<lb/>
to the deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling<lb/>
off the water; &#x201C;Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of<lb/>
thing often happen?&#x201D; Without much emotion, though soaked<lb/>
through just like me, he gave me to understand that such things<lb/>
did often happen.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mr. Stubb,&#x201D; said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up<lb/>
in his oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain;<lb/>
&#x201C;Mr. Stubb, I think I have heard you say that of all whalemen<lb/>
you ever met, our chief mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most<lb/>
careful and prudent. I suppose then, that going plump on a<lb/>
flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of<lb/>
a whaleman&#x0027;s discretion?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Certain. I&#x0027;ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a<lb/>
gale off Cape Horn.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mr. Flask,&#x201D; said I, turning to little King-Post, who was<lb/>
standing close by; &#x201C;you are experienced in these things, and I<lb/>
am not. Will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in<lb/>
this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an oarsman to break his own back<lb/>
pulling himself back-foremost into death&#x0027;s jaws?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can&#x0027;t you twist that smaller?&#x201D; said Flask. &#x201C;Yes, that&#x0027;s the<lb/>
law. I should like to see a boat&#x0027;s crew backing water up to a<lb/>
whale face foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint<lb/>
for squint, mind that!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate<lb/>
statement of the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls<lb/>
and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n291" n="254"/>
deep, were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life;<lb/>
considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on<lb/>
to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who<lb/>
steered the boat&#x2014;oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment<lb/>
is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with<lb/>
his own frantic stampings; considering that the particular disas-<lb/>
ter to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to Star-<lb/>
buck&#x0027;s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall,<lb/>
and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for<lb/>
his great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged<lb/>
to this uncommonly prudent Starbuck&#x0027;s boat; and finally consi-<lb/>
dering in what a devil&#x0027;s chase I was implicated, touching the<lb/>
White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I thought I<lb/>
might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will.<lb/>
&#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;come along, you shall be my lawyer,<lb/>
executor, and legatee.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinker-<lb/>
ing at their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in<lb/>
the world more fond of that diversion. This was the fourth<lb/>
time in my nautical life that I had done the same thing. After<lb/>
the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion, I felt<lb/>
all the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart. Be-<lb/>
sides, all the days I should now live would be as good as the<lb/>
days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary<lb/>
clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be.<lb/>
I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my<lb/>
chest. I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a<lb/>
quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a<lb/>
snug family vault.</p>
<p>Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of<lb/>
my frock, here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and de-<lb/>
struction, and the devil fetch the hindmost.</p>

<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="sc">Who</hi> would have thought it, Flask!&#x201D; cried Stubb; &#x201C;if I<lb/>
had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe<lb/>
to stop the plug-hole with my timber toe. Oh! he&#x0027;s a wonder-<lb/>
ful old man!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t think it so strange, after all, on that account,&#x201D; said<lb/>
Flask. &#x201C;If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a<lb/>
different thing. That would disable him; but he has one knee,<lb/>
and good part of the other left, you know.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him<lb/>
kneel.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;</p>
<p>Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether,<lb/>
considering the paramount importance of his life to the success<lb/>
of the voyage, it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize<lb/>
that life in the active perils of the chase. So Tamerlane&#x0027;s sol-<lb/>
diers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that invalu-<lb/>
able life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight.</p>
<p>But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Con-<lb/>
sidering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all<lb/>
times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is<lb/>
always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every in-<lb/>
dividual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these<lb/>
circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-<lb/>
boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of the<lb/>
Pequod must have plainly thought not.</p>
<p>Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would<lb/>
think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively<lb/>
harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n293" n="256"/>
scene of action and giving his orders in person, yet for Captain<lb/>
Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular<lb/>
headsman in the hunt&#x2014;above all for Captain Ahab to be sup-<lb/>
plied with five extra men, as that same boat&#x0027;s crew, he well<lb/>
knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the<lb/>
owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat&#x0027;s<lb/>
crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that<lb/>
head. Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own<lb/>
touching all that matter. Until Cabaco&#x0027;s published discovery,<lb/>
the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure when, after<lb/>
being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the cus-<lb/>
tomary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when<lb/>
some time after this Ahab was now and then found bestir-<lb/>
ring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his own<lb/>
hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and<lb/>
even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when<lb/>
the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow:<lb/>
when all this was observed in him, and particularly his solici-<lb/>
tude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the<lb/>
boat, as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of<lb/>
his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shap-<lb/>
ing the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes called,<lb/>
the horizontal piece in the boat&#x0027;s bow for bracing the knee<lb/>
against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was ob-<lb/>
served how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee<lb/>
fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the<lb/>
carpenter&#x0027;s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a<lb/>
little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest<lb/>
and curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that<lb/>
this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be<lb/>
with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had<lb/>
already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster<lb/>
in person. But such a supposition did by no means involve<lb/>
the remotest suspicion as to any boat&#x0027;s crew being assigned to<lb/>
that boat.</p>
<pb xml:id="n294" n="257"/>
<p>Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained<lb/>
soon waned away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Be-<lb/>
sides, now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange<lb/>
nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the<lb/>
earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships<lb/>
themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found<lb/>
tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whale-<lb/>
boats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that<lb/>
Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into<lb/>
the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create any<lb/>
unsubduable excitement in the forecastle.</p>
<p>But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordi-<lb/>
nate phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though<lb/>
still as it were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-tur-<lb/>
baned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last. Whence<lb/>
he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of unac-<lb/>
countable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a half-<lb/>
hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even<lb/>
authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sus-<lb/>
tain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a<lb/>
creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only<lb/>
see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom<lb/>
now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communi-<lb/>
ties, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent&#x2014;<lb/>
those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even<lb/>
in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly abori-<lb/>
ginalness of earth&#x0027;s primal generations, when the memory of the<lb/>
first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants,<lb/>
unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms,<lb/>
and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and<lb/>
to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels in-<lb/>
deed consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add<lb/>
the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the spirit-spout</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Days</hi>, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod<lb/>
had slowly swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off<lb/>
the Azores; off the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called),<lb/>
being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol<lb/>
Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from St.<lb/>
Helena.</p>
<p>It was while gliding through these latter waters that one<lb/>
serene and moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like<lb/>
scrolls of silver; and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made<lb/>
what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude: on such a silent<lb/>
night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles<lb/>
at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial; seemed<lb/>
some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea. Fedal-<lb/>
lah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight nights, it<lb/>
was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a<lb/>
look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day.<lb/>
And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night, not one<lb/>
whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them.<lb/>
You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld<lb/>
this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his<lb/>
turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But when, after<lb/>
spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights<lb/>
without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,<lb/>
his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit<lb/>
jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some<lb/>
winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal<lb/>
crew. &#x201C;There she blows!&#x201D; Had the trump of judgment<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n296" n="259"/>
blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt<lb/>
no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was a most unwonted<lb/>
hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting,<lb/>
that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.</p>
<p>Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab<lb/>
commanded the t&#x0027;gallant sails and royals to be set, and every<lb/>
stunsail spread. The best man in the ship must take the helm.<lb/>
Then, with every mast-head manned, the piled-up craft rolled<lb/>
down before the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of<lb/>
the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails, made the<lb/>
buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet; while still<lb/>
she rushed along, as if two antagonistic influences were strug-<lb/>
gling in her&#x2014;one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive<lb/>
yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s face that night, you would have thought that in him<lb/>
also two different things were warring. While his one live leg<lb/>
made lively echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead<lb/>
limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and death this old man<lb/>
walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from<lb/>
every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet<lb/>
was no more seen that night. Every sailor swore he saw it<lb/>
once, but not a second time.</p>
<p>This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing,<lb/>
when, some days after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again<lb/>
announced: again it was descried by all; but upon making sail<lb/>
to overtake it, once more it disappeared as if it had never been.<lb/>
And so it served us night after night, till no one heeded it but<lb/>
to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight,<lb/>
or starlight, as the case might be; disappearing again for one<lb/>
whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow seeming at<lb/>
every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and<lb/>
further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring<lb/>
us on.</p>
<p>Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n297" n="260"/>
accordance with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in<lb/>
many things invested the Pequod, were there wanting some of<lb/>
the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried;<lb/>
at however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and<lb/>
longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by one self-same<lb/>
whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there reigned,<lb/>
too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as if it<lb/>
were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the<lb/>
monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the<lb/>
remotest and most savage seas.</p>
<p>These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful,<lb/>
derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the<lb/>
weather, in which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought<lb/>
there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged<lb/>
along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space,<lb/>
in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of<lb/>
life before our urn-like prow.</p>
<p>But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds<lb/>
began howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long,<lb/>
troubled seas that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod<lb/>
sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in<lb/>
her madness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foam-<lb/>
flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity<lb/>
of life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than<lb/>
before.</p>
<p>Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither<lb/>
and thither before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscru-<lb/>
table sea-ravens. And every morning, perched on our stays,<lb/>
rows of these birds were seen; and spite of our hootings, for a<lb/>
long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they<lb/>
deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing<lb/>
appointed to desolation, and thereffit roosting-place for their<lb/>
homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly<lb/>
heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n298" n="261"/>
the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the<lb/>
long sin and suffering it had bred.</p>
<p>Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tor-<lb/>
mentoto, as called of yore; for long allured by the perfidious<lb/>
silences that before had attended us, we found ourselves<lb/>
launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings trans-<lb/>
formed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned<lb/>
to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat<lb/>
that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and<lb/>
unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky;<lb/>
still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at<lb/>
times be descried.</p>
<p>During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though<lb/>
assuming for the time the almost continual command of the<lb/>
drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve;<lb/>
and more seldom than ever addressed his mates. In tempestu-<lb/>
ous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been<lb/>
secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the<lb/>
issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical<lb/>
fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed<lb/>
hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for<lb/>
hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while<lb/>
an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his<lb/>
very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the<lb/>
forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly<lb/>
broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in the<lb/>
waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each<lb/>
man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the<lb/>
rail, in which he swung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words<lb/>
were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by painted<lb/>
sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift mad-<lb/>
ness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same<lb/>
muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed;<lb/>
still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n299" n="262"/>
Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed<lb/>
demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock.<lb/>
Never could Starbuck forget the old man&#x0027;s aspect, when<lb/>
one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer<lb/>
stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor-<lb/>
screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from<lb/>
which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping<lb/>
from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him<lb/>
lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which<lb/>
have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his<lb/>
tightly clenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head<lb/>
was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards<lb/>
the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.<note xml:id="fn8-262"><p>The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to<lb/>
the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of<lb/>
the course of the ship.</p></note></p>
<p>Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping<lb/>
in this gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the albatross</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">South-eastward</hi> from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a<lb/>
good cruising ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed<lb/>
ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she slowly drew<lb/>
nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had a good<lb/>
view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean<lb/>
fisheries&#x2014;a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.</p>
<p>As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like<lb/>
the skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n300" n="263"/>
spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened<lb/>
rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick<lb/>
branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower<lb/>
sails were set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded<lb/>
look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in the<lb/>
skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had<lb/>
survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops<lb/>
nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless<lb/>
sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided close under our<lb/>
stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we<lb/>
might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to<lb/>
those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly<lb/>
eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-<lb/>
outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?&#x201D;</p>
<p>But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks,<lb/>
was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow<lb/>
fell from his hand into the sea; and the wind now rising<lb/>
amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard without it.<lb/>
Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between.<lb/>
While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were<lb/>
evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first<lb/>
mere mention of the White Whale&#x0027;s name to another ship,<lb/>
Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he<lb/>
would have lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the<lb/>
threatening wind forbade. But taking advantage of his win-<lb/>
dward position, he again seized his trumpet, and knowing by her<lb/>
aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly<lb/>
bound home, he loudly hailed&#x2014;&#x201D; Ahoy there! This is the<lb/>
Pequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all<lb/>
future letters to the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if<lb/>
I am not at home, tell them to address them to&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and<lb/>
instantly, then, in accordance with their singular ways, shoals<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n301" n="264"/>
of small harmless fish, that for some days before had been<lb/>
placidly swimming by our side, darted away with what seemed<lb/>
shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with the<lb/>
stranger&#x0027;s flanks. Though in the course of his continual voyag-<lb/>
ings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet,<lb/>
to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry<lb/>
meanings.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Swim away from me, do ye?&#x201D; murmured Ahab, gazing<lb/>
over into the water. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane<lb/>
old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the steersman,<lb/>
who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish<lb/>
her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,&#x2014; &#x201C;Up helm!<lb/>
Keep her off round the world!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire<lb/>
proud feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation con-<lb/>
duct? Only through numberless perils to the very point whence<lb/>
we started, where those that we left behind secure, were all<lb/>
the time before us.</p>
<p>Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward<lb/>
we could for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more<lb/>
sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solo-<lb/>
mon, then there were promise in the voyage. But in pursuit<lb/>
of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase<lb/>
of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before<lb/>
all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they<lb/>
either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d53" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the gam</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the<lb/>
whaler we had spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n302" n="265"/>
storms. But even had this not been the case, he would not<lb/>
after all, perhaps, have boarded her&#x2014;judging by his subsequent<lb/>
conduct on similar occasions&#x2014;if so it had been that, by the<lb/>
process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the<lb/>
question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain,<lb/>
except he could contribute some of that information he so<lb/>
absorbingly sought. But all this might remain inadequately<lb/>
estimated, were not something said here of the peculiar usages<lb/>
of whaling-vessels when meeting each other in foreign seas, and<lb/>
especially on a common cruising-ground.</p>
<p>If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York<lb/>
State, or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if<lb/>
casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds,<lb/>
these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual<lb/>
salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news;<lb/>
and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert:<lb/>
then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine<lb/>
Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels<lb/>
descrying each other at the ends of the earth&#x2014;off lone Fan-<lb/>
ning&#x0027;s Island, or the far away King&#x0027;s Mills; how much more<lb/>
natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should<lb/>
not only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more<lb/>
friendly and sociable contact. And especially would this seem to<lb/>
be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one sea-<lb/>
port, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are<lb/>
personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts<lb/>
of dear domestic things to talk about.</p>
<p>For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has<lb/>
letters on board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have<lb/>
some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on<lb/>
her blurred and thumb-worn files. And in return for that<lb/>
courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whal-<lb/>
ing intelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n303" n="266"/>
destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And in de-<lb/>
gree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing<lb/>
each other&#x0027;s track on the cruising-ground itself, even though they<lb/>
are equally long absent from home. For one of them may have<lb/>
received a transfer of letters from some third, and now far remote<lb/>
vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of the<lb/>
ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whal-<lb/>
ing news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only would<lb/>
they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all<lb/>
the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and<lb/>
mutually shared privations and perils.</p>
<p>Nor would difference of country make any very essential dif-<lb/>
ference; that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as<lb/>
is the case with Americans and English. Though, to be sure,<lb/>
from the small number of English whalers, such meetings do not<lb/>
very often occur, and when they do occur there is too apt to be<lb/>
a sort of shyness between them; for your Englishman is rather<lb/>
reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing<lb/>
in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers some-<lb/>
times affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the Ameri-<lb/>
can whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his<lb/>
nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where<lb/>
this superiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it<lb/>
would be hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day,<lb/>
collectively, kill more whales than all the English, collectively, in<lb/>
ten years. But this is a harmless little foible in the English whale-<lb/>
hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much to heart;<lb/>
probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.</p>
<p>So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea,<lb/>
the whalers have most reason to be sociable&#x2014;and they are so.<lb/>
Whereas, some merchant ships crossing each other&#x0027;s wake in the<lb/>
mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without so much as a sin-<lb/>
gle word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the<lb/>
high seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n304" n="267"/>
time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon each other&#x0027;s<lb/>
rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea,<lb/>
they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrap-<lb/>
ings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be<lb/>
much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it<lb/>
at all. As touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such<lb/>
a prodigious hurry, they run away from each other as soon as<lb/>
possible. And as for Pirates, when they chance to cross each<lb/>
other&#x0027;s cross-bones, the first hail is&#x2014; &#x201C;How many skulls?&#x201D;&#x2014;<lb/>
the same way that whalers hail&#x2014; &#x201C;How many barrels?&#x201D; And<lb/>
that question once answered, pirates straightway steer apart, for<lb/>
they are infernal villains on both sides, and don&#x0027;t like to see<lb/>
overmuch of each other&#x0027;s villanous likenesses.</p>
<p>But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable,<lb/>
sociable, free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when<lb/>
she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather? She<lb/>
has a &#x201C;<hi rend="i">Gam</hi>,&#x201D; a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships<lb/>
that they never heard of the name even; and if by chance<lb/>
they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat game-<lb/>
some stuff about &#x201C;spouters&#x201D; and &#x201C;blubber-boilers,&#x201D; and such<lb/>
like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen,<lb/>
and also all Pirates and Man-of-War&#x0027;s men, and Slave-ship<lb/>
sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships;<lb/>
this is a question it would be hard to answer. Because, in the<lb/>
case of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profes-<lb/>
sion of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It sometimes<lb/>
ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows.<lb/>
And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has<lb/>
no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I con-<lb/>
clude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whale-<lb/>
man, in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.</p>
<p>But what is a <hi rend="i">Gam?</hi> You might wear out your index-finger<lb/>
running up and down the columns of dictionaries, and never<lb/>
find the word. Dr. Johnson never attained to that erudition;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n305" n="268"/>
Noah Webster&#x0027;s ark does not hold it. Nevertheless, this same<lb/>
expressive word has now for many years been in constant use<lb/>
among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it<lb/>
needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon.<lb/>
With that view, let me learnedly define it.</p>
<p>GAM. <hi rend="sc">Noun</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="i">A social meeting of two (or more) Whale-<lb/>
ships, generally on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging<lb/>
hails, they exchange visits by boats&#x0027; crews: the two captains<lb/>
remaining, for the time, on board of one ship, and the two<lb/>
chief mates on the other.</hi></p>
<p>There is another little item about Gamming which must not<lb/>
be forgotten here. All professions have their own little peculiari-<lb/>
ties of detail; so has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-<lb/>
war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his<lb/>
boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, some-<lb/>
times cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a<lb/>
pretty little milliner&#x0027;s tiller decorated with gay cords and rib-<lb/>
bons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that<lb/>
sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whal-<lb/>
ing captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty<lb/>
old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-<lb/>
boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in<lb/>
gamming a complete boat&#x0027;s crew must leave the ship, and hence<lb/>
as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that subordi-<lb/>
nate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, having<lb/>
no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine<lb/>
tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes<lb/>
of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the<lb/>
two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the importance<lb/>
of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this<lb/>
any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting<lb/>
steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back,<lb/>
the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He<lb/>
is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only ex-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n306" n="269"/>
pand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs;<lb/>
but a sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple<lb/>
him, because length of foundation is nothing without correspond-<lb/>
ing breadth. Merely make a spread angle of two poles, and<lb/>
you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it would never do in<lb/>
plain sight of the world&#x0027;s riveted eyes, it would never do, I say,<lb/>
for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the<lb/>
slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands;<lb/>
indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he gene-<lb/>
rally carries his hands in his trowsers&#x0027; pockets; but perhaps be-<lb/>
ing generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for<lb/>
ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authen-<lb/>
ticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an<lb/>
uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say&#x2014;-<lb/>
to seize hold of the nearest oarsman&#x0027;s hair, and hold on there<lb/>
like grim death.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round<lb/>

<p>It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another<lb/>
homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,<note xml:id="fn9-269"><p>The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-<lb/>
head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.</p></note> was encountered.<lb/>
She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam<lb/>
that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick. To some<lb/>
the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly height-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n307" n="270"/>
ened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho&#x0027;s story, which seemed<lb/>
obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, invert-<lb/>
ed visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which<lb/>
at times are said to overtake some men. This latter circum-<lb/>
stance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what<lb/>
may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrat-<lb/>
ed, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates.<lb/>
For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of<lb/>
the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three<lb/>
confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems,<lb/>
communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secresy,<lb/>
but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and re-<lb/>
vealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened<lb/>
he could not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an<lb/>
influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod<lb/>
who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange<lb/>
delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that<lb/>
they kept the secret among themselves so that it never trans-<lb/>
pired abaft the Pequod&#x0027;s main-mast. Interweaving in its proper<lb/>
place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on<lb/>
the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put<lb/>
on lasting record.</p>
<p>For my humor&#x0027;s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I<lb/>
once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish<lb/>
friends, one saint&#x0027;s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza<lb/>
of the Golden Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons,<lb/>
Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and<lb/>
hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and which<lb/>
are duly answered at the time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some two years prior to my first learning the events which<lb/>
I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm<lb/>
Whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very<lb/>
many days&#x0027; sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden<lb/>
Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n308" n="271"/>
morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it<lb/>
was observed that she made more water in her hold than com-<lb/>
mon. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen.<lb/>
But the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that<lb/>
rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore<lb/>
being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then<lb/>
considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find<lb/>
it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather<lb/>
heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the ma-<lb/>
riners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but<lb/>
no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the<lb/>
leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so,<lb/>
that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood<lb/>
away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to have<lb/>
his hull hove out and repaired.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the com-<lb/>
monest chance favored, he did not at all fear that his ship would<lb/>
founder by the way, because his pumps were of the best, and<lb/>
being periodically relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of<lb/>
his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should<lb/>
double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage<lb/>
being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had<lb/>
all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without<lb/>
the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal<lb/>
overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly<lb/>
provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado<lb/>
from Buffalo.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Lakeman!&#x2014;Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where<lb/>
is Buffalo?&#x2019; said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of<lb/>
grass.</p>
<p>&#x201C;On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but&#x2014;I crave your<lb/>
courtesy&#x2014;may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,<lb/>
gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well nigh<lb/>
as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n309" n="272"/>
to far Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our Ameri-<lb/>
ca, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting im-<lb/>
pressions popularly connected with the open ocean. For in their<lb/>
interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,<lb/>
&#x2014;Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,&#x2014;-<lb/>
possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the ocean&#x0027;s no-<lb/>
blest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of<lb/>
climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles,<lb/>
even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by<lb/>
two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish<lb/>
long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies<lb/>
from the East, dotted all round their banks; here and there are<lb/>
frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of<lb/>
lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval<lb/>
victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barba-<lb/>
rians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wig-<lb/>
wams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and<lb/>
unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines<lb/>
of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring<lb/>
wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported<lb/>
furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved<lb/>
capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago<lb/>
villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the<lb/>
armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe;<lb/>
they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any<lb/>
that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for<lb/>
out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full<lb/>
many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gen-<lb/>
tlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and<lb/>
wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any.<lb/>
And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him<lb/>
down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea;<lb/>
though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic<lb/>
and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n310" n="273"/>
and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh<lb/>
from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet<lb/>
was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and<lb/>
this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed,<lb/>
might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common<lb/>
decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave&#x0027;s<lb/>
right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harm-<lb/>
less and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but<lb/>
Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt&#x2014;but, gentle-<lb/>
men, you shall hear.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after point-<lb/>
ing her prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho&#x0027;s leak<lb/>
seemed again increasing, but only so as to require an hour or<lb/>
more at the pumps every day. You must know that in a set-<lb/>
tled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some<lb/>
skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it;<lb/>
though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen<lb/>
to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that<lb/>
he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on ac-<lb/>
count of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the<lb/>
solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentle-<lb/>
men, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their<lb/>
pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable<lb/>
length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if<lb/>
any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when<lb/>
a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those<lb/>
waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to<lb/>
feel a little anxious.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her<lb/>
leak was found gaining once more, there was in truth some small<lb/>
concern manifested by several of her company; especially by<lb/>
Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well<lb/>
hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the<lb/>
breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n311" n="274"/>
and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness<lb/>
touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on<lb/>
land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen.<lb/>
Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the<lb/>
ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account<lb/>
of his being a part owner in her. So when they were working<lb/>
that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small<lb/>
gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with<lb/>
their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water;<lb/>
clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen&#x2014;that bubbling from<lb/>
the pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady<lb/>
spouts at the lee scupper-holes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this con-<lb/>
ventional world of ours&#x2014;watery or otherwise; that when a<lb/>
person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of<lb/>
them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of<lb/>
manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an uncon-<lb/>
querable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he<lb/>
will pull down and pulverize that subaltern&#x0027;s tower, and make<lb/>
a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,<lb/>
gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal<lb/>
with a head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the<lb/>
tasseled housings of your last viceroy&#x0027;s snorting charger; and a<lb/>
brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made<lb/>
Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne&#x0027;s<lb/>
father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as<lb/>
hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt,<lb/>
and Steelkilt knew it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump<lb/>
with the rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but un-<lb/>
awed, went on with his gay banterings.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Aye, aye, my merry lads, it&#x0027;s a lively leak this; hold a<lb/>
cannikin, one of ye, and let&#x0027;s have a taste. By the Lord, it&#x0027;s<lb/>
worth bottling! I tell ye what, men, old Rad&#x0027;s investment<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n312" n="275"/>
must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull and<lb/>
tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the<lb/>
job; he&#x0027;s come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,<lb/>
saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of<lb/>
&#x0027;em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;<lb/>
making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now,<lb/>
I&#x0027;d tell him to jump overboard and scatter &#x0027;em. They&#x0027;re play-<lb/>
ing the devil with his estate, I can tell him. But he&#x0027;s a simple<lb/>
old soul,&#x2014;Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say the rest of<lb/>
his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he&#x0027;d<lb/>
give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Damn your eyes! what&#x0027;s that pump stopping for?&#x0027; roared<lb/>
Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailors&#x0027; talk. &#x2018;Thun-<lb/>
der away at it!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Aye, aye, sir,&#x2019; said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. &#x2018;Lively,<lb/>
boys, lively, now!&#x2019; And with that the pump clanged like<lb/>
fifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere<lb/>
long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes<lb/>
the fullest tension of life&#x0027;s utmost energies.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the<lb/>
Lakeman went forward all panting, and sat himself down on<lb/>
the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping<lb/>
the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what cozening fiend<lb/>
it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a<lb/>
man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so it<lb/>
happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate com-<lb/>
manded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and<lb/>
also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent<lb/>
upon allowing a pig to run at large.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship&#x0027;s deck at sea is a piece of<lb/>
household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly<lb/>
attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the<lb/>
case of ships actually foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen,<lb/>
is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neat-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n313" n="276"/>
ness in seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown with-<lb/>
out first washing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business<lb/>
is the prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard.<lb/>
Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been<lb/>
divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the<lb/>
most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly<lb/>
assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should<lb/>
have been freed from any trivial business not connected with<lb/>
truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades.<lb/>
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand ex-<lb/>
actly how this affair stood between the two men.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But there was more than this: the order about the<lb/>
shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt,<lb/>
as though Radney had spat in his face. Any man who has<lb/>
gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all this<lb/>
and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended<lb/>
when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for a<lb/>
moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate&#x0027;s malignant<lb/>
eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him<lb/>
and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he<lb/>
instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwilling-<lb/>
ness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful<lb/>
being&#x2014;a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant<lb/>
men even when aggrieved&#x2014;this nameless phantom feeling, gen-<lb/>
tlemen, stole over Steelkilt.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the<lb/>
bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him<lb/>
saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, and he<lb/>
would not do it. And then, without at all alluding to the shovel,<lb/>
he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers; who, not<lb/>
being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day.<lb/>
To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and<lb/>
outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command;<lb/>
meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n314" n="277"/>
uplifted cooper&#x0027;s club hammer which he had snatched from a<lb/>
cask near by.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the<lb/>
pumps, for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the<lb/>
sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate;<lb/>
but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him,<lb/>
without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till<lb/>
at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few<lb/>
inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, stead-<lb/>
ily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberate-<lb/>
ly repeated his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his<lb/>
forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and un-<lb/>
speakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the<lb/>
foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in<lb/>
this way the two went once slowly round the windlass; when,<lb/>
resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he<lb/>
had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the<lb/>
Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away,<lb/>
or look to yourself.&#x2019; But the predestinated mate coming still<lb/>
closer to him, where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the<lb/>
heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeat-<lb/>
ing a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the<lb/>
thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the<lb/>
unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right<lb/>
hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his per-<lb/>
secutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt)<lb/>
would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded<lb/>
for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer<lb/>
touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate<lb/>
was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like<lb/>
a whale.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n315" n="278"/>
backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were<lb/>
standing their mast-heads. They were both Canallers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Canallers!&#x2019; cried Don Pedro. &#x201C;&#x2018;We have seen many whale-<lb/>
ships in our harbors, but never heard of your Canallers. Par-<lb/>
don: who and what are they?&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand<lb/>
Erie Canal. You must have heard of it.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and<lb/>
hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha&#x0027;s very<lb/>
fine; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canal-<lb/>
lers are; for such information may throw side-light upon my<lb/>
story.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the<lb/>
entire breadth of the state of New York; through numerous<lb/>
populous cities and most thriving villages; through long, dismal,<lb/>
uninhabited swamps, and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for<lb/>
fertility; by billiard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-<lb/>
holies of great forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers;<lb/>
through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken; through<lb/>
all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk coun-<lb/>
ties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose<lb/>
spires stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream<lb/>
of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There&#x0027;s your true<lb/>
Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where you<lb/>
ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung shadow,<lb/>
and the snug patronizing lee of churches. For by some curious<lb/>
fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters<lb/>
that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners,<lb/>
gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Is that a friar passing?&#x2019; said Don Pedro, looking down-<lb/>
wards into the crowded plazza, with humorous concern.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella&#x0027;s Inquisi-<lb/>
tion wanes in Lima,&#x2019; laughed Don Sebastian. &#x2018; Proceed, Senor.&#x2019;</p>
<pb xml:id="n316" n="279"/>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;A moment! Pardon!&#x2019; cried another of the company.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;In the name of all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you,<lb/>
sir sailor, that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy<lb/>
in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your cor-<lb/>
rupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look surprised; you<lb/>
know the proverb all along this coast&#x2014;&#x201C; Corrupt as Lima.&#x201D; It<lb/>
but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than<lb/>
billiard-tables, and for ever open&#x2014;and &#x201C;Corrupt as Lima.&#x201D; So,<lb/>
too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed<lb/>
evangelist, St. Mark!&#x2014;St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup!<lb/>
Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Ca-<lb/>
naller would make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and pic-<lb/>
turesquely wicked is he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days<lb/>
along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly<lb/>
toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot<lb/>
thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is<lb/>
dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly<lb/>
sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand<lb/>
features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages<lb/>
through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger<lb/>
are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own<lb/>
canal, I have received good turns from one of these Canallers; I<lb/>
thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often<lb/>
one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence,<lb/>
that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in<lb/>
a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what<lb/>
the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this;<lb/>
that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished<lb/>
graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney<lb/>
men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor<lb/>
does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to<lb/>
many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along<lb/>
its line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n317" n="280"/>
sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field,<lb/>
and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;I see! I see!&#x2019; impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling<lb/>
his chicha upon his silvery ruffles. &#x2018;No need to travel! The<lb/>
world&#x0027;s one Lima. I had thought, now, that at your temperate<lb/>
North the generations were cold and holy as the hills.&#x2014;But the<lb/>
story.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the back-<lb/>
stay. Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the<lb/>
three junior mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded<lb/>
him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets,<lb/>
the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag<lb/>
their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors<lb/>
joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued;<lb/>
while standing out of harm&#x0027;s way, the valiant captain danced<lb/>
up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to<lb/>
manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to<lb/>
the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving<lb/>
border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his<lb/>
pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment. But<lb/>
Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they<lb/>
succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing<lb/>
about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass,<lb/>
these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Come out of that, ye pirates!&#x2019; roared the captain, now<lb/>
menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him<lb/>
by the steward. &#x2018;Come out of that, ye cut-throats!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down<lb/>
there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the cap-<lb/>
tain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt&#x0027;s) death would<lb/>
be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands.<lb/>
Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the cap-<lb/>
tain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly<lb/>
to return to their duty.</p>
<pb xml:id="n318" n="281"/>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?&#x2019; demanded<lb/>
their ringleader.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Turn to! turn to!&#x2014;I make no promise;&#x2014;to your duty!<lb/>
Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like<lb/>
this? Turn to!&#x2019; and he once more raised a pistol.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Sink the ship?&#x2019; cried Steelkilt. &#x2018;Aye, let her sink.&#x2019; Not<lb/>
a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn<lb/>
against us. What say ye, men?&#x201D; turning to his comrades. A<lb/>
fierce cheer was their response.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while<lb/>
keeping his eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences<lb/>
as these:&#x2014;&#x0027; It&#x0027;s not our fault; we didn&#x0027;t want it; I told him<lb/>
to take his hammer away; it was boy&#x0027;s business; he might<lb/>
have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo;<lb/>
I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw;<lb/>
ain&#x0027;t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men?<lb/>
look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look<lb/>
to yourself; say the word; don&#x0027;t be a fool; forget it all; we<lb/>
are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we&#x0027;re your men;<lb/>
but we won&#x0027;t be flogged.&#x0027;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Look ye, now,&#x2019; cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm<lb/>
towards him, &#x2018;there are a few of us here (and I am one of<lb/>
them) who have shipped for the cruise, d&#x0027;ye see; now as you<lb/>
well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor<lb/>
is down; so we don&#x0027;t want a row; it&#x0027;s not our interest; we<lb/>
want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won&#x0027;t be<lb/>
flogged.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Turn to!&#x2019; roared the Captain.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:&#x2014;&#x2018; I<lb/>
tell you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be<lb/>
hung for such a shabby rascal, we won&#x0027;t lift a hand against ye<lb/>
unless ye attack us; but till you say the word about not flog-<lb/>
ging us, we don&#x0027;t do a hand&#x0027;s turn.&#x2019;</p>
<pb xml:id="n319" n="282"/>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I&#x0027;ll keep ye<lb/>
there till ye&#x0027;re sick of it. Down ye go.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Shall we? cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them<lb/>
were against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they<lb/>
preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappear-<lb/>
ing, like bears into a cave.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As the Lakeman&#x0027;s bare head was just level with the planks,<lb/>
the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly<lb/>
drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands<lb/>
upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy<lb/>
brass padlock belonging to the companion-way. Then opening<lb/>
the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down the<lb/>
crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them&#x2014;ten in num-<lb/>
ber&#x2014;leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had<lb/>
remained neutral.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, for-<lb/>
ward and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatch-<lb/>
way; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might<lb/>
emerge, after breaking through the bulkhead below. But the<lb/>
hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained<lb/>
at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and<lb/>
clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded<lb/>
through the ship.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the<lb/>
deck, summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they re-<lb/>
fused. Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple<lb/>
of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when again turning<lb/>
the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the<lb/>
quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated;<lb/>
but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a<lb/>
scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;<lb/>
and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they<lb/>
were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a<lb/>
famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribu-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n320" n="283"/>
tion had constrained them to surrender at discretion. Embold-<lb/>
ened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest, but<lb/>
Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling<lb/>
and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning<lb/>
three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the<lb/>
desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three<lb/>
were left.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Better turn to, now?&#x2019; said the Captain with a heartless<lb/>
jeer.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Shut us up again, will ye!&#x2019; cried Steelkilt.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Oh! certainly,&#x2019; said the Captain, and the key clicked.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection<lb/>
of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking<lb/>
voice that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long<lb/>
entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair; it<lb/>
was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far<lb/>
apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at<lb/>
the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their<lb/>
keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with<lb/>
a handle at each end) run a muck from the bowsprit to the<lb/>
taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize<lb/>
the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they<lb/>
joined him or not. That was the last night he should spend in<lb/>
that den. But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of<lb/>
the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any<lb/>
other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And<lb/>
what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on<lb/>
deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to<lb/>
this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for<lb/>
himself; particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the<lb/>
one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be<lb/>
first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time. And<lb/>
here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come<lb/>
out.</p>
<pb xml:id="n321" n="284"/>
<p>&#x201C; Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his<lb/>
own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon<lb/>
the same piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in break-<lb/>
ing out, in order to be the first of the three, though the last of<lb/>
the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance<lb/>
of pardon such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made<lb/>
known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in<lb/>
some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their be-<lb/>
fore secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into<lb/>
a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three<lb/>
sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged<lb/>
him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at mid-<lb/>
night.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the<lb/>
blood, he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for<lb/>
the forecastle. In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and,<lb/>
bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was shoved<lb/>
up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the<lb/>
honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder.<lb/>
But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like<lb/>
dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizen<lb/>
rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till<lb/>
morning. &#x2018;Damn ye,&#x2019; cried the Captain, pacing to and fro<lb/>
before them, &#x2018;the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those<lb/>
who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the<lb/>
mutiny, he told the former that he had a good mind to flog<lb/>
them all round&#x2014;thought, upon the whole, he would do so&#x2014;-<lb/>
he ought to&#x2014;justice demanded it; but for the present, con-<lb/>
sidering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a<lb/>
reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacu-<lb/>
lar.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;But as for you, ye carrion rogues,&#x2019; turning to the three<lb/>
men in the rigging&#x2014;&#x2018;for you, I mean to mince ye up for the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n322" n="285"/>
try-pots;&#x2019; and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might<lb/>
to the backs of the two traitors, till they yelled no more, but<lb/>
lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves<lb/>
are drawn.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;My wrist is sprained with ye!&#x2019; he cried, at last; &#x2018;but<lb/>
there is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that<lb/>
couldn&#x0027;t give up. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us<lb/>
hear what he can say for himself.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous<lb/>
motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round<lb/>
his head, said in a sort of hiss, &#x2018;What I say is this&#x2014;and mind<lb/>
it well&#x2014;if you flog me, I murder you!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me&#x2019;&#x2014;and the Cap-<lb/>
tain drew off with the rope to strike.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Best not,&#x2019; hissed the Lakeman.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;But I must,&#x2019;&#x2014;and the rope was once more drawn back for<lb/>
the stroke.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the<lb/>
Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back,<lb/>
paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly<lb/>
throwing down his rope, said, &#x2018;I won&#x0027;t do it&#x2014;let him go&#x2014;cut<lb/>
him down: d&#x0027;ye hear?&#x2019;</p>
<p>But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order,<lb/>
a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them&#x2014;Radney the<lb/>
chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but<lb/>
that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept<lb/>
out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the<lb/>
state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling<lb/>
something about <hi rend="i">his</hi> being willing and able to do what the<lb/>
captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced<lb/>
to his pinioned foe.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;You are a coward!&#x2019; hissed the Lakeman.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;So I am, but take that.&#x2019; The mate was in the very act of<lb/>
striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused:<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n323" n="286"/>
and then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steel-<lb/>
kilt&#x0027;s threat, whatever that might have been. The three men<lb/>
were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly<lb/>
worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below,<lb/>
a clamor was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling<lb/>
traitors running up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst<lb/>
not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could<lb/>
not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put<lb/>
down in the ship&#x0027;s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny<lb/>
reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that<lb/>
mainly at Steelkilt&#x0027;s instigation, they had resolved to maintain<lb/>
the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when<lb/>
the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to<lb/>
insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to ano-<lb/>
ther thing&#x2014;namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any<lb/>
should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all<lb/>
her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads,<lb/>
and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that<lb/>
moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground;<lb/>
and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth<lb/>
for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death<lb/>
the vital jaw of the whale.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt<lb/>
this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own coun-<lb/>
sel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and<lb/>
private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ven-<lb/>
tricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate&#x0027;s watch;<lb/>
and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way<lb/>
to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted,<lb/>
against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the<lb/>
head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other<lb/>
circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his<lb/>
revenge.</p>
<pb xml:id="n324" n="287"/>
<p>&#x201C;During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting<lb/>
on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon<lb/>
the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little<lb/>
above the ship&#x0027;s side. In this attitude, it was well known, he<lb/>
sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between<lb/>
the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea.<lb/>
Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the<lb/>
helm would come round at two o&#x0027;clock, in the morning of the<lb/>
third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his<lb/>
leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very<lb/>
carefully in his watches below.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;What are you making there?&#x2019; said a shipmate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;What do you think? what does it look like?&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Like a lanyard for your bag; but it&#x0027;s an odd one, seems to<lb/>
me.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Yes, rather oddish,&#x2019; said the Lakeman, holding it at arm&#x0027;s<lb/>
length before him; &#x201C; but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I<lb/>
haven&#x0027;t enough twine,&#x2014;have you any?&#x0027;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But there was none in the forecastle.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Then I must get some from old Rad;&#x2019; and he rose to go aft.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;You don&#x0027;t mean to go a begging to <hi rend="i">him!&#x2019;</hi> said a sailor.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Why not? Do you think he won&#x0027;t do me a turn, when it&#x0027;s<lb/>
to help himself in the end, shipmate?&#x2019; and going to the mate,<lb/>
he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to<lb/>
mend his hammock. It was given him&#x2014;neither twine nor lan-<lb/>
yard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely<lb/>
netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman&#x0027;s monkey<lb/>
jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pil-<lb/>
low. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm&#x2014;-<lb/>
nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always<lb/>
ready dug to the seaman&#x0027;s hand&#x2014;that fatal hour was then to<lb/>
come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was<lb/>
already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed<lb/>
in.</p>
<pb xml:id="n325" n="288"/>
<p>&#x201C;But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the<lb/>
bloody deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had,<lb/>
and without being the avenger. For by a mysterious fatality,<lb/>
Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its<lb/>
own the damning thing he would have done.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of<lb/>
the second day, when they were washing down the decks, that<lb/>
a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at<lb/>
once shouted out, &#x2018;There she rolls! there she rolls!&#x2019; Jesu,<lb/>
what a whale! It was Moby Dick.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Moby Dick!&#x2019; cried Don Sebastian; &#x2018;St. Dominic! Sir<lb/>
sailor, but do whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby<lb/>
Dick?&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal<lb/>
monster, Don;&#x2014;but that would be too long a story.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;How? how?&#x2019; cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Nay, Dons, Dons&#x2014;nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now,<lb/>
Let me get more into the air, Sirs.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;The chicha! the chicha!&#x2019; cried Don Pedro; &#x2018;our vigorous<lb/>
friend looks faint;&#x2014;fill up up his empty glass!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.&#x2014;Now.<lb/>
gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty<lb/>
yards of the ship&#x2014;forgetful of the compact among the crew&#x2014;-<lb/>
in the excitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had in-<lb/>
stinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster,<lb/>
though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld<lb/>
from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. &#x2018;The<lb/>
White Whale&#x2014;the White Whale!&#x2019; was the cry from captain,<lb/>
mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumors, were<lb/>
all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the<lb/>
dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling<lb/>
beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal<lb/>
spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the<lb/>
blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n326" n="289"/>
whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the<lb/>
world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of<lb/>
the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next<lb/>
him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and<lb/>
haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. More-<lb/>
over, when the four boats were lowered, the mate&#x0027;s got the start;<lb/>
and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt,<lb/>
as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer<lb/>
got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He<lb/>
was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his<lb/>
bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale&#x0027;s topmost back.<lb/>
Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a<lb/>
blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a<lb/>
sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling<lb/>
over, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on<lb/>
the whale&#x0027;s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed<lb/>
aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea,<lb/>
on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the<lb/>
spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil,<lb/>
wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick.<lb/>
But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized<lb/>
the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him,<lb/>
plunged headlong again, and went down.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Meantime, at the first tap of the boat&#x0027;s bottom, the Lake-<lb/>
man had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirl-<lb/>
pool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But<lb/>
a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly<lb/>
brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was<lb/>
free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some<lb/>
tatters of Radney&#x0027;s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that<lb/>
had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the<lb/>
whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port&#x2014;a savage,<lb/>
solitary place&#x2014;where no civilized creature resided. There,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n327" n="290"/>
headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremast-men<lb/>
deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned<lb/>
out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting<lb/>
sail for some other harbor.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The ship&#x0027;s company being reduced to but a handful, the<lb/>
captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious<lb/>
business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to<lb/>
such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this<lb/>
small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day,<lb/>
and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon<lb/>
the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weak-<lb/>
ened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in<lb/>
so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he<lb/>
anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran<lb/>
out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the<lb/>
poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at<lb/>
their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his<lb/>
best whaleboat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five<lb/>
hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.</p>
<p>&#x201C;On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried,<lb/>
which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He<lb/>
steered away from it; but the savage craft bore down on him;<lb/>
and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he<lb/>
would run him under water. The captain presented a pistol.<lb/>
With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the<lb/>
Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol<lb/>
so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles<lb/>
and foam.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;What do you want of me?&#x2019; cried the captain.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?&#x2019;<lb/>
demanded Steelkilt; &#x2018;no lies.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;I am bound to Tahiti for more men.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Very good. Let me board you a moment&#x2014;I come in<lb/>
peace.&#x2019; With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n328" n="291"/>
boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the<lb/>
captain.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat<lb/>
after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this<lb/>
boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not,<lb/>
may lightnings strike me!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;A pretty scholar,&#x2019; laughed the Lakeman. &#x2018;Adios, Senor!&#x2019;<lb/>
and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up<lb/>
to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again,<lb/>
and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination.<lb/>
There, luck befriended him; two ships were about to sail for<lb/>
France, and were providentially in want of precisely that num-<lb/>
ber of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so<lb/>
for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all<lb/>
minded to work them legal retribution.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat<lb/>
arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more<lb/>
civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea.<lb/>
Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to<lb/>
his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his<lb/>
cruisings.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon<lb/>
the island of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the<lb/>
sea which refuses to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the<lb/>
awful white whale that destroyed him.&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Are you through?&#x2019; said Don Sebastian, quietly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;I am, Don.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own con-<lb/>
victions, this your story is in substance really true? It is so<lb/>
passing wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable<lb/>
source? Bear with me if I seem to press.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don<lb/>
Sebastian&#x0027;s suit,&#x2019; cried the company, with exceeding interest.</p>
<pb xml:id="n329" n="292"/>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,<lb/>
gentlemen?&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Nay,&#x2019; said Don Sebastian; &#x2018;but I know a worthy priest<lb/>
near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but<lb/>
are you well advised? this may grow too serious.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Though there are no Auto-da-F&#x00E9;s in Lima now,&#x2019; said one<lb/>
of the company to another; &#x2018;I fear our sailor friend runs risk<lb/>
of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moon-<lb/>
light. I see no need of this.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may<lb/>
I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest<lb/>
sized Evangelists you can.&#x2019; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,&#x2019; said<lb/>
Don Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into<lb/>
the light, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch<lb/>
it.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told<lb/>
ye, gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know<lb/>
it to be true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew<lb/>

<head>CHAPTER LV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">of the monstrous pictures of whales</hi>.</head>
<p>I <hi rend="sc">shall</hi> ere long paint to you as well as one can without can-<lb/>
vas, something like the true form of the whale as he actually ap-<lb/>
pears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body<lb/>
the whale is moored alongside the whale-ship so that he can be<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n330" n="293"/>
fairly stepped upon there. It may be worth while, therefore,<lb/>
previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him<lb/>
which even down to the present day confidently challenge the<lb/>
faith of the landsman. It is time to set the world right in this<lb/>
matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.</p>
<p>It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delu-<lb/>
sions will be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and<lb/>
Grecian sculptures. For ever since those inventive but unscru-<lb/>
pulous times when on the marble panellings of temples, the pe-<lb/>
destals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins,<lb/>
the dolphin was drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin&#x0027;s,<lb/>
and a helmeted head like St. George&#x0027;s; ever since then has<lb/>
something of the same sort of license prevailed, not only in<lb/>
most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific pre-<lb/>
sentations of him.</p>
<p>Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways<lb/>
purporting to be the whale&#x0027;s, is to be found in the famous ca-<lb/>
vern-pagoda of Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain<lb/>
that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pago-<lb/>
da, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of<lb/>
man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came<lb/>
into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble pro-<lb/>
fession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The<lb/>
Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of<lb/>
the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of<lb/>
leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though<lb/>
this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the<lb/>
tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong.<lb/>
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the<lb/>
broad palms of the true whale&#x0027;s majestic flukes.</p>
<p>But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian<lb/>
painter&#x0027;s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the<lb/>
antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido&#x0027;s picture of Perseus rescuing<lb/>
Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n331" n="294"/>
get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor does<lb/>
Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own &#x201C;Perseus De-<lb/>
scending,&#x201D; make out one whit better. The huge corpulence of<lb/>
that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely<lb/>
drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows<lb/>
are rolling, might be taken for the Traitors&#x0027; Gate leading from<lb/>
the Thames by water into the Tower. Then, there are the<lb/>
Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah&#x0027;s whale,<lb/>
as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old pri-<lb/>
mers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder&#x0027;s<lb/>
whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descend-<lb/>
ing anchor&#x2014;as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages<lb/>
of many books both old and new&#x2014;that is a very picturesque<lb/>
but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like<lb/>
figures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a<lb/>
dolphin, I nevertheless call this book-binder&#x0027;s fish an at-<lb/>
tempt at a whale; because it was so intended when the device<lb/>
was first introduced. It was introduced by an old Italian pub-<lb/>
lisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival of<lb/>
Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively<lb/>
late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of<lb/>
the Leviathan.</p>
<p>In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient<lb/>
books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the<lb/>
whale, where all manner of spouts, jets d&#x0027;eau, hot springs and<lb/>
cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his<lb/>
unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original edition of<lb/>
the &#x201C;Advancement of Learning&#x201D; you will find some curious<lb/>
whales.</p>
<p>But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance<lb/>
at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific<lb/>
delineations, by those who know. In old Harris&#x0027;s collection of<lb/>
voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a Dutch<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n332" n="295"/>
book of voyages, A. D. 1671, entitled &#x201C;A Whaling Voyage to<lb/>
Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of<lb/>
Friesland, master.&#x201D; In one of those plates the whales, like<lb/>
great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with<lb/>
white bears running over their living backs. In another plate,<lb/>
the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with<lb/>
perpendicular flukes.</p>
<p>Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Cap-<lb/>
tain Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled &#x201C;A<lb/>
Voyage round Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose<lb/>
of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.&#x201D; In this book<lb/>
is an outline purporting to be a &#x201C;Picture of a Physeter or<lb/>
Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast<lb/>
of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.&#x201D; I doubt not<lb/>
the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of<lb/>
his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say<lb/>
that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompany-<lb/>
ing scale, to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of<lb/>
that whale a bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant<lb/>
captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that<lb/>
eye!</p>
<p>Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural His-<lb/>
tory for the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same<lb/>
heinousness of mistake. Look at that popular work &#x201C;Gold-<lb/>
smith&#x0027;s Animated Nature.&#x201D; In the abridged London edition of<lb/>
1807, there are plates of an alleged &#x201C;whale&#x201D; and a &#x201C;narwhale.&#x201D;<lb/>
I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks<lb/>
much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one<lb/>
glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth<lb/>
century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any<lb/>
intelligent public of schoolboys.</p>
<p>Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lac&#x00E9;p&#x00E8;de,<lb/>
a great naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book,<lb/>
wherein are several pictures of the different species of the Levia-<lb/>
than.</p>
<pb xml:id="n333" n="296"/>
<p>All these are not only incorrect, but the picture of the<lb/>
Mysticetus or Greenland whale (that is to say, the Right whale),<lb/>
even Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching that spe-<lb/>
cies, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.</p>
<p>But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering busi-<lb/>
ness was reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to<lb/>
the famous Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History<lb/>
of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a picture of the<lb/>
Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer,<lb/>
you had best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket.<lb/>
In a word, Frederick Cuvier&#x0027;s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale,<lb/>
but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of a whal-<lb/>
ing voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived<lb/>
that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific<lb/>
predecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authen-<lb/>
tic abortions; that is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort<lb/>
of lively lads with the pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups<lb/>
and saucers inform us.</p>
<p>As for the sign-painters&#x0027; whales seen in the streets hanging<lb/>
over the shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They<lb/>
are generally Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and<lb/>
very savage; breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is<lb/>
whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities floundering in<lb/>
seas of blood and blue paint.</p>
<p>But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so<lb/>
very surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific draw-<lb/>
ings have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are<lb/>
about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken<lb/>
back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its<lb/>
undashed pride of hull and spars. Though elephants have<lb/>
stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet<lb/>
fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in his<lb/>
full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in un-<lb/>
fathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n334" n="297"/>
sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that ele-<lb/>
ment it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist<lb/>
him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells<lb/>
and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable<lb/>
difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full-<lb/>
grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of<lb/>
those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship&#x0027;s deck, such is<lb/>
then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him,<lb/>
that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.</p>
<p>But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the<lb/>
stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true<lb/>
form. Not at all. For it is one of the more curious things<lb/>
about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little idea of<lb/>
his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham&#x0027;s skeleton, which<lb/>
hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors,<lb/>
correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old<lb/>
gentleman, with all Jeremy&#x0027;s other leading personal characteris-<lb/>
tics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any levia-<lb/>
than&#x0027;s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the<lb/>
mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully<lb/>
invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis<lb/>
that so roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly<lb/>
evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side<lb/>
fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the<lb/>
human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular<lb/>
bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all<lb/>
these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the<lb/>
human fingers in an artificial covering. &#x201C;However recklessly<lb/>
the whale may sometimes serve us,&#x201D; said humorous Stubb one<lb/>
day, &#x201C;he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must<lb/>
needs conclude that the great Leviathan is that one crea-<lb/>
ture in the world which must remain unpainted to the last.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n335" n="298"/>
True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another,<lb/>
but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exact-<lb/>
ness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what<lb/>
the whale really looks like. And the only mode in which you<lb/>
can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by<lb/>
going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small<lb/>
risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it<lb/>
seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity<lb/>
touching this Leviathan.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d56" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LVI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">of the less erroneous pictures of whales, and the true<lb/>
pictures of whaling scenes</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">In</hi> connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am<lb/>
strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous<lb/>
stories of them which are to be found in certain books, both<lb/>
ancient and modern, especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt,<lb/>
Harris, Cuvier, &#x0026;c. But I pass that matter by.</p>
<p>I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm<lb/>
Whale; Colnett&#x0027;s, Huggins&#x0027;s, Frederick Cuvier&#x0027;s, and Beale&#x0027;s.<lb/>
In the previous chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred<lb/>
to. Huggins&#x0027;s is far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale&#x0027;s<lb/>
is the best. All Beale&#x0027;s drawings of this whale are good, except-<lb/>
ing the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various atti-<lb/>
tudes, capping his second chapter. His frontispiece, boats<lb/>
attacking Sperm Whales, though no doubt calculated to excite the<lb/>
civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and<lb/>
life-like in its general effect. Some of the Sperm Whale<lb/>
drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but<lb/>
they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.</p>
<pb xml:id="n336" n="299"/>
<p>Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby;<lb/>
but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable<lb/>
impression. He has but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is<lb/>
a sad deficiency, because it is by such pictures only, when at all<lb/>
well done, that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of<lb/>
the living whale as seen by his living hunters.</p>
<p>But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some<lb/>
details not the most correct, presentations of whales and<lb/>
whaling scenes to be anywhere found, are two large French en-<lb/>
gravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one<lb/>
Garnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the Sperm<lb/>
and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale<lb/>
is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat<lb/>
from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air<lb/>
upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The<lb/>
prow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balanc-<lb/>
ing upon the monster&#x0027;s spine; and standing in that prow, for<lb/>
that one single incomputable flash of time, you behold an oars-<lb/>
man, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale,<lb/>
and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of<lb/>
the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-<lb/>
emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles<lb/>
of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the<lb/>
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting ex-<lb/>
pressions of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship<lb/>
is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found<lb/>
with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that pass;<lb/>
since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one.</p>
<p>In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing<lb/>
alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale,<lb/>
that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-<lb/>
slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and<lb/>
black like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the<lb/>
chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n337" n="300"/>
in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small<lb/>
crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the<lb/>
Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all<lb/>
the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the<lb/>
deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and<lb/>
causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught<lb/>
nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the fore-<lb/>
ground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable<lb/>
artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the droop-<lb/>
ing unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of<lb/>
a dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture<lb/>
lazily hanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.</p>
<p>Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my<lb/>
life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject,<lb/>
or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.<lb/>
The French are the lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon<lb/>
all the paintings of Europe, and where will you find such a<lb/>
gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in<lb/>
that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder fights his<lb/>
way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of France;<lb/>
where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and<lb/>
the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge<lb/>
of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that<lb/>
gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.</p>
<p>The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesque-<lb/>
ness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings<lb/>
and engravings they have of their whaling scenes. With not<lb/>
one tenth of England&#x0027;s experience in the fishery, and not the<lb/>
thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have neverthe-<lb/>
less furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all<lb/>
capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt. For<lb/>
the most part, the English and American whale draughtsmen<lb/>
seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of<lb/>
things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n338" n="301"/>
picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to<lb/>
sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly<lb/>
renowned Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of<lb/>
the Greenland whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of<lb/>
narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engrav-<lb/>
ings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with<lb/>
the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the in-<lb/>
spection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified<lb/>
Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement to the ex-<lb/>
cellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so important<lb/>
a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for<lb/>
every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice<lb/>
of the Peace.</p>
<p>In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are<lb/>
two other French engravings worthy of note, by some one who<lb/>
subscribes himself &#x201C;H. Durand.&#x201D; One of them, though not<lb/>
precisely adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless deserves<lb/>
mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among<lb/>
the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in<lb/>
a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of<lb/>
the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,<lb/>
both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very<lb/>
fine, when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy<lb/>
fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose.<lb/>
The other engraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to<lb/>
upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the Leviathanic<lb/>
life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of<lb/>
cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a<lb/>
boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about<lb/>
giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and<lb/>
lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the<lb/>
mast in its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little<lb/>
craft stands half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse.<lb/>
From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n339" n="302"/>
is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to<lb/>
windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and<lb/>
rains, seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d57" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LVII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">of whales in paint; in teeth; in wood; in sheet-iron;<lb/>
in stone; in mountains; in stars</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">On</hi> Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you<lb/>
may have seen a crippled beggar (or <hi rend="i">kedger</hi>, as the sailors say)<lb/>
holding a painted board before him, representing the tragic<lb/>
scene in which he lost his leg. There are three whales and<lb/>
three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to contain the<lb/>
missing leg in all its original integrity) is being crunched by<lb/>
the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years,<lb/>
they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited<lb/>
that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justi-<lb/>
fication has now come. His three whales are as good whales<lb/>
as were ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his<lb/>
stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the<lb/>
western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump,<lb/>
never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with<lb/>
downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own amputa-<lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New<lb/>
Bedford, and Sag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches<lb/>
of whales and whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen them-<lb/>
selves on Sperm Whale-teeth, or ladies&#x0027; busks wrought out of<lb/>
the Right Whale-bone, and other like skrimshander articles, as<lb/>
the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances<lb/>
they elaborately carve out of the rough material, in their hours<lb/>
of ocean leisure. Some of them have little boxes of dentistical-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n340" n="303"/>
looking implements, specially intended for the skrimshandering<lb/>
business. But, in general, they toil with their jack-knives alone;<lb/>
and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor, they will<lb/>
turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner&#x0027;s<lb/>
fancy.</p>
<p>Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably<lb/>
restores a man to that condition in which God placed him, <hi rend="i">i. e.</hi><lb/>
what is called savagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a<lb/>
savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a savage, owning no alle-<lb/>
giance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready at any<lb/>
moment to rebel against him.</p>
<p>Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his<lb/>
domestic hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An<lb/>
ancient Hawaiian war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multipli-<lb/>
city and elaboration of carving, is as great a trophy of human<lb/>
perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but a bit of broken<lb/>
sea-shell or a shark&#x0027;s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden<lb/>
net-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady years of<lb/>
steady application.</p>
<p>As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-<lb/>
savage. With the same marvellous patience, and with the<lb/>
same single shark&#x0027;s tooth, of his one poor jack-knife, he will<lb/>
carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite as workmanlike,<lb/>
but as close packed in its maziness of design, as the Greek<lb/>
savage, Achilles&#x0027;s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and suggest-<lb/>
iveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert<lb/>
Durer.</p>
<p>Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small<lb/>
dark slabs of the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met<lb/>
with in the forecastles of American whalers. Some of them<lb/>
are done with much accuracy.</p>
<p>At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see<lb/>
brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the road-side<lb/>
door. When the porter is sleepy, the anvil-headed whale<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n341" n="304"/>
would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom remark-<lb/>
able as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned<lb/>
churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for weather-<lb/>
cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all in-<lb/>
tents and purposes so labelled with &#x201C;<hi rend="i">Hands off!</hi>&#x201D; you cannot<lb/>
examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.</p>
<p>In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high<lb/>
broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings<lb/>
upon the plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified<lb/>
forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy<lb/>
day breaks against them in a surf of green surges.</p>
<p>Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is<lb/>
continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there<lb/>
from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses<lb/>
of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges.<lb/>
But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see these sights;<lb/>
and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight<lb/>
again, you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude<lb/>
and longitude of your first stand-point, else so chance-like are<lb/>
such observations of the hills, that your precise, previous stand-<lb/>
point would require a laborious re-discovery; like the Soloma<lb/>
islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed<lb/>
Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.</p>
<p>Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to<lb/>
trace out great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pur-<lb/>
suit of them; as when long filled with thoughts of war the<lb/>
Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds.<lb/>
Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic skies<lb/>
I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against<lb/>
the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and<lb/>
the Flying Fish.</p>
<p>With a frigate&#x0027;s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of har-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n342" n="305"/>
poons for spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the<lb/>
topmost skies, to see whether the fabled heavens with all their<lb/>
countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!</p>

<head>CHAPTER LVIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">brit</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Steering</hi> north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with<lb/>
vast meadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which<lb/>
the Right Whale largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it<lb/>
undulated round us, so that we seemed to be sailing through<lb/>
boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.</p>
<p>On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen,<lb/>
who, secure from the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the<lb/>
Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit,<lb/>
which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous Venetian<lb/>
blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the<lb/>
water that escaped at the lip.</p>
<p>As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly<lb/>
advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy<lb/>
meads; even so these monsters swam, making a strange, grassy,<lb/>
cutting sound; and leaving behind them endless swaths of<lb/>
blue upon the yellow sea.<note xml:id="fn10-305"><p>That part of the sea known among whalemen as the &#x201C;Brazil Banks&#x201D;<lb/>
does not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because<lb/>
of there being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remark-<lb/>
able meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually<lb/>
floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.</p></note></p>
<p>But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit<lb/>
which at all reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-<lb/>
heads, especially when they paused and were stationary for a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n343" n="306"/>
while, their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of<lb/>
rock than anything else. And as in the great hunting<lb/>
countries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes<lb/>
pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them<lb/>
to be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the<lb/>
soil; even so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds<lb/>
this species of the leviathans of the sea. And even when re-<lb/>
cognised at last, their immense magnitude renders it very hard<lb/>
really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can<lb/>
possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort of life that<lb/>
lives in a dog or a horse.</p>
<p>Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures<lb/>
of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the<lb/>
shore. For though some old naturalists have maintained that<lb/>
all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and<lb/>
though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very<lb/>
well be; yet coming to specialities, where, for example, does the<lb/>
ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the<lb/>
sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can<lb/>
in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to<lb/>
him.</p>
<p>But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of<lb/>
the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably<lb/>
unsocial and repelling; though we know the sea to be an ever-<lb/>
lasting terra incognita, so that Columbus sailed over number-<lb/>
less unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one;<lb/>
though, by vast odds, the most terrific of all mortal disasters<lb/>
have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and<lb/>
hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the<lb/>
waters; though but a moment&#x0027;s consideration will teach, that<lb/>
however baby man may brag of his science and skill, and<lb/>
however much, in a flattering future, that science and skill may<lb/>
augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the<lb/>
sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the stateliest,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n344" n="307"/>
stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual<lb/>
repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense of<lb/>
the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.</p>
<p>The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with<lb/>
Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without<lb/>
leaving so much as a widow. That same ocean rolls now;<lb/>
that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year.<lb/>
Yea, foolish mortals, Noah&#x0027;s flood is not yet subsided; two<lb/>
thirds of the fair world it yet covers.</p>
<p>Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one<lb/>
is not a miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested<lb/>
upon the Hebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his company<lb/>
the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever; yet<lb/>
not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner<lb/>
the live sea swallows up ships and crews.</p>
<p>But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to<lb/>
it, but it is also a fiend to its own offspring; worse than the<lb/>
Persian host who murdered his own guests; sparing not the<lb/>
creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage tigress<lb/>
that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea<lb/>
dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves<lb/>
them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No<lb/>
mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting<lb/>
like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless<lb/>
ocean overruns the globe.</p>
<p>Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded<lb/>
creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and<lb/>
treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Con-<lb/>
sider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most<lb/>
remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many<lb/>
species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibal-<lb/>
ism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other,<lb/>
carrying on eternal war since the world began.</p>
<p>Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n345" n="308"/>
most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land;<lb/>
and do you not find a strange analogy to something in<lb/>
yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant<lb/>
land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of<lb/>
peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half<lb/>
known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle,<lb/>
thou canst never return!</p>

<head>CHAPTER LIX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">squid</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Slowly</hi> wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod<lb/>
still held on her way north-eastward towards the island of Java;<lb/>
a gentle air impelling her keel, so that in the surrounding<lb/>
serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that<lb/>
languid breeze, as three mild palms on a plain. And still, at<lb/>
wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet would<lb/>
be seen.</p>
<p>But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost<lb/>
preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any<lb/>
stagnant calm; when the long burnished sun-glade on the waters<lb/>
seemed a golden finger laid across them, enjoining some secresy;<lb/>
when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran<lb/>
on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre<lb/>
was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.</p>
<p>In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising<lb/>
higher and higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at<lb/>
last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from<lb/>
the hills. Thus glistening for a moment, as slowly it subsided,<lb/>
and sank. Then once more arose, and silently gleamed. It<lb/>
seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick? thought<lb/>
Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n346" n="309"/>
once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from<lb/>
his nod, the negro yelled out&#x2014;&#x201C;There! there again! there she<lb/>
breaches! right ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarm-<lb/>
ing-time the bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the<lb/>
sultry sun, Ahab stood on the bowsprit, and with one hand<lb/>
pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helms-<lb/>
man, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the<lb/>
outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.</p>
<p>Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary<lb/>
jet had gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now pre-<lb/>
pared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first<lb/>
sight of the particular whale he pursued; however this was, or<lb/>
whether his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might<lb/>
have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass,<lb/>
than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for low-<lb/>
ering.</p>
<p>The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab&#x0027;s in advance,<lb/>
and all swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and<lb/>
while, with oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance,<lb/>
lo! in the same spot where it sank, once more it slowly rose.<lb/>
Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby Dick,<lb/>
we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the<lb/>
secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy<lb/>
mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing cream-color,<lb/>
lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating<lb/>
from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of anacon-<lb/>
das, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.<lb/>
No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token<lb/>
of either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the bil-<lb/>
lows, an unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.</p>
<p>As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again,<lb/>
Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk,<lb/>
with a wild voice exclaimed&#x2014;&#x201C;Almost rather had I seen Moby<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n347" n="310"/>
Dick and fought him, than to have seen thee, thou white<lb/>
ghost!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What was it, Sir?&#x201D; said Flask.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever<lb/>
beheld, and returned to their ports to tell of it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to<lb/>
the vessel; the rest as silently following.</p>
<p>Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have<lb/>
connected with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a<lb/>
glimpse of it being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone<lb/>
far to invest it with portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that<lb/>
though one and all of them declare it to be the largest ani-<lb/>
mated thing in the ocean, yet very few of them have any but<lb/>
the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form;<lb/>
notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale<lb/>
his only food. For though other species of whales find their<lb/>
food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feed-<lb/>
ing, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown<lb/>
zones below the surface; and only by inference is it that any<lb/>
one can tell of what, precisely, that food consists. At times,<lb/>
when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are supposed to be<lb/>
the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited<lb/>
exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that<lb/>
the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by<lb/>
them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike<lb/>
other species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.</p>
<p>There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken<lb/>
of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid.<lb/>
The manner in which the Bishop describes it, as alternately ris-<lb/>
ing and sinking, with some other particulars he narrates, in all<lb/>
this the two correspond. But much abatement is necessary<lb/>
with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.</p>
<p>By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the<lb/>
mysterious creature, here spoken of, it is included among the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n348" n="311"/>
class of cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects<lb/>
it would seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d60" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the line</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">With</hi> reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described,<lb/>
as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes else-<lb/>
where presented, I have here to speak of the magical, some-<lb/>
times horrible whale-line.</p>
<p>The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp,<lb/>
slightly vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the<lb/>
case of ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes<lb/>
the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the<lb/>
rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use;<lb/>
yet, not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the<lb/>
whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected;<lb/>
but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no<lb/>
means adds to the rope&#x0027;s durability or strength, however much<lb/>
it may give it compactness and gloss.</p>
<p>Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery<lb/>
almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines;<lb/>
for, though not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more<lb/>
soft and elastic; and I will add (since there is an &#x00E6;sthetics in<lb/>
all things), is much more handsome and becoming to the boat,<lb/>
than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian;<lb/>
but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.</p>
<p>The whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness.<lb/>
At first sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is.<lb/>
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight<lb/>
of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will<lb/>
bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n349" n="312"/>
sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fa-<lb/>
thoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away<lb/>
in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as<lb/>
to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded<lb/>
&#x201C;sheaves,&#x201D; or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any<lb/>
hollow but the &#x201C;heart,&#x201D; or minute vertical tube formed at the<lb/>
axis of the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling<lb/>
would, in running out, infallibly take somebody&#x0027;s arm, leg, or<lb/>
entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the<lb/>
line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire<lb/>
morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then<lb/>
reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in<lb/>
the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.</p>
<p>In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the<lb/>
same line being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is<lb/>
some advantage in this; because these twin-tubs being so small<lb/>
they fit more readily into the boat, and do not strain it so much;<lb/>
whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and<lb/>
of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a<lb/>
craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for the<lb/>
bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up<lb/>
a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a con-<lb/>
centrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on<lb/>
the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off<lb/>
with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.</p>
<p>Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminat-<lb/>
ing in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against<lb/>
the side of the tub, and hanging over its edge completely dis-<lb/>
engaged from everything. This arrangement of the lower end<lb/>
is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the<lb/>
fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in<lb/>
case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten<lb/>
to carry off the entire line originally attached to the har-<lb/>
poon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n350" n="313"/>
a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other;<lb/>
though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort.<lb/>
Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety&#x0027;s<lb/>
sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached<lb/>
to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the<lb/>
end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does,<lb/>
he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly<lb/>
be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea;<lb/>
and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.</p>
<p>Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the<lb/>
line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the logger-<lb/>
head there, is again carried forward the entire length of the<lb/>
boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man&#x0027;s<lb/>
oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing<lb/>
between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gun-<lb/>
wales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed<lb/>
prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a<lb/>
common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks<lb/>
it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed<lb/>
inside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called<lb/>
box-line) being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues<lb/>
its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then<lb/>
attached to the short-warp&#x2014;the rope which is immediately con-<lb/>
nected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the<lb/>
short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to<lb/>
detail.</p>
<p>Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated<lb/>
coils, twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.<lb/>
All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so<lb/>
that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian<lb/>
jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their<lb/>
limbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time,<lb/>
seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while straining<lb/>
his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n351" n="314"/>
instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible con-<lb/>
tortion be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus<lb/>
circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow<lb/>
in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit&#x2014;<lb/>
trange thing! what cannot habit accomplish?&#x2014;Gayer sallies,<lb/>
more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you<lb/>
never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the<lb/>
half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in<lb/>
hangman&#x0027;s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before<lb/>
King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the<lb/>
jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may<lb/>
say.</p>
<p>Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account<lb/>
for those repeated whaling disasters&#x2014;some few of which are<lb/>
casually chronicled&#x2014;of this man or that man being taken out<lb/>
of the boat by the line, and lost. For, when the line is darting<lb/>
out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the<lb/>
midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play,<lb/>
when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.<lb/>
It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these<lb/>
perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are<lb/>
pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning;<lb/>
and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneous-<lb/>
ness of volition and action, can you escape being made a<lb/>
Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun him-<lb/>
self could never pierce you out.</p>
<p>Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes<lb/>
and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the<lb/>
storm itself; for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and<lb/>
envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the seemingly<lb/>
harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explo-<lb/>
sion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines<lb/>
about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play&#x2014;this<lb/>
is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n352" n="315"/>
aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men<lb/>
live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round<lb/>
their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden<lb/>
turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present<lb/>
perils of life. And if you be a philosopher, though seated in<lb/>
the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of<lb/>
terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a<lb/>
poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">If</hi> to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of<lb/>
portents, to Queequeg it was quite a different object.</p>
<p>&#x201C;When you see him &#x2018;quid,&#x201D; said the savage, honing his<lb/>
harpoon in the bow of his hoisted boat, &#x201C;then you quick see<lb/>

<p>The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with<lb/>
nothing special to engage them, the Pequod&#x0027;s crew could hardly<lb/>
resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this<lb/>
part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging<lb/>
is not what whalemen call a lively ground; that is, it affords<lb/>
fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other<lb/>
vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the Rio<lb/>
de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.</p>
<p>It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my<lb/>
shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and<lb/>
fro I idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolu-<lb/>
tion could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all con-<lb/>
sciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my<lb/>
body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the<lb/>
power which first moved it is withdrawn.</p>
<pb xml:id="n353" n="316"/>
<p>Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that<lb/>
the seamen at the main and mizen mast-heads were already<lb/>
drowsy. So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from<lb/>
the spars, and for every swing that we made there was a nod<lb/>
from below from the slumbering helmsman. The waves, too,<lb/>
nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance of the<lb/>
sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.</p>
<p>Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes;<lb/>
like vices my hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious<lb/>
agency preserved me; with a shock I came back to life. And<lb/>
lo! close under our lee, not forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm<lb/>
Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate,<lb/>
his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue, glistening in the<lb/>
sun&#x0027;s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in the trough of<lb/>
the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet,<lb/>
the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a<lb/>
warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As<lb/>
if struck by some enchanter&#x0027;s wand, the sleepy ship and every<lb/>
sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness; and more than<lb/>
a score of voices from all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as<lb/>
the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine<lb/>
into the air.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Clear away the boats! Luff!&#x201D; cried Ahab. And obeying<lb/>
his own order, he dashed the helm down before the helmsman<lb/>
could handle the spokes.</p>
<p>The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the<lb/>
whale; and ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he<lb/>
swam away to the leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity,<lb/>
and making so few ripples as he swam, that thinking after all<lb/>
he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an<lb/>
oar should be used, and no man must speak but in whispers.<lb/>
So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats, we<lb/>
swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n354" n="317"/>
the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in<lb/>
chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into<lb/>
the air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There go flukes!&#x201D; was the cry, an announcement immedi-<lb/>
ately followed by Stubb&#x0027;s producing his match and igniting his<lb/>
pipe, for now a respite was granted. After the full interval<lb/>
of his sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again, and being<lb/>
now in advance of the smoker&#x0027;s boat, and much nearer to it<lb/>
than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the honor of the<lb/>
capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length be-<lb/>
come aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was<lb/>
therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars<lb/>
came loudly into play. And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb<lb/>
cheered on his crew to the assault.</p>
<p>Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to<lb/>
his jeopardy, he was going &#x201C;head out;&#x201D; that part obliquely pro-<lb/>
jecting from the mad yeast which he brewed.<note xml:id="fn11-317"><p>It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance<lb/>
the entire interior of the sperm whale&#x0027;s enormous head consists. Though<lb/>
apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about<lb/>
him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does so<lb/>
when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the<lb/>
upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water for-<lb/>
mation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he thereby<lb/>
may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish galliot into<lb/>
a sharp-pointed New York pilot-boat.</p></note></p>
<p>&#x201C;Start her, start her, my men! Don&#x0027;t hurry yourselves; take<lb/>
plenty of time&#x2014;but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that&#x0027;s<lb/>
all,&#x201D; cried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. &#x201C;Start<lb/>
her, now; give &#x0027;em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego.<lb/>
Start her, Tash, my boy&#x2014;start her, all; but keep cool, keep<lb/>
cool&#x2014;cucumbers is the word&#x2014;easy, easy&#x2014;only start her like<lb/>
grim death and grinning devils, and raise the buried dead per-<lb/>
pendicular out of their graves, boys&#x2014;that&#x0027;s all. Start her!&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n355" n="318"/>
<p>&#x201C;Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!&#x201D; screamed the Gay-Header in reply,<lb/>
raising some old war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in<lb/>
the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one<lb/>
tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave.</p>
<p>But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild.<lb/>
&#x201C;Kee-hee! Kee-hee!&#x201D; yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and<lb/>
backwards on his seat, like a pacing tiger in his cage.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ka-la! Koo-loo!&#x201D; howled Queequeg, as if smacking his<lb/>
lips over a mouthful of Grenadier&#x0027;s steak. And thus with oars<lb/>
and yells the keels cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his<lb/>
place in the van, still encouraged his men to the onset, all the<lb/>
while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like desperadoes they<lb/>
tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard&#x2014;&#x201C;<lb/>
tand up, Tashtego!&#x2014;give it to him!&#x201D; The harpoon was<lb/>
hurled. &#x201C;Stern all!&#x201D; The oarsmen backed water; the same<lb/>
moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their<lb/>
wrists. It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had<lb/>
swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the logger-<lb/>
head, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a<lb/>
hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady<lb/>
fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and round the<lb/>
loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it blister-<lb/>
ingly passed through and through both of Stubb&#x0027;s hands, from<lb/>
which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes<lb/>
worn at these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like<lb/>
holding an enemy&#x0027;s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and<lb/>
that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wet the line! wet the line!&#x201D; cried Stubb to the tub oars-<lb/>
man (him seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat,<lb/>
dashed the sea-water into it.<note xml:id="fn12-318"><p>Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be<lb/>
stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running<lb/>
line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set<lb/>
apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most convenient.</p></note> More turns were taken, so that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n356" n="319"/>
the line began holding its place. The boat now flew through<lb/>
the boiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego here<lb/>
changed places&#x2014;stem for stern&#x2014;a staggering business truly in<lb/>
that rocking commotion.</p>
<p>From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the<lb/>
upper part of the boat, and from its now being more tight than<lb/>
a harpstring, you would have thought the craft had two keels&#x2014;<lb/>
one cleaving the water, the other the air&#x2014;as the boat churned<lb/>
on through both opposing elements at once. A continual cas-<lb/>
cade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake;<lb/>
and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little<lb/>
finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodie<lb/>
gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with<lb/>
might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to<lb/>
the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar<lb/>
crouching almost double, in order to bring down his centre of<lb/>
gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they<lb/>
shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened<lb/>
his flight.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Haul in&#x2014;haul in!&#x201D; cried Stubb to the bowsman! and,<lb/>
facing round towards the whale, all hands began pulling the<lb/>
boat up to him, while yet the boat was being towed on. Soon<lb/>
ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the<lb/>
clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish; at<lb/>
the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out of<lb/>
the way of the whale&#x0027;s horrible wallow, and then ranging up<lb/>
for another fling.</p>
<p>The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like<lb/>
brooks down a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine<lb/>
but in blood, which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in<lb/>
their wake. The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond<lb/>
in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they<lb/>
all glowed to each other like red men. And all the while, jet<lb/>
after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n357" n="320"/>
of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of<lb/>
the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his<lb/>
crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it<lb/>
again and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then<lb/>
again and again sent it into the whale.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pull up&#x2014;pull up!&#x201D; he now cried to the bowsman, as the<lb/>
waning whale relaxed in his wrath. &#x201C;Pull up!&#x2014;close to!&#x201D;<lb/>
and the boat ranged along the fish&#x0027;s flank. When reaching far<lb/>
over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the<lb/>
fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if<lb/>
cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale<lb/>
might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of breaking<lb/>
ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was<lb/>
the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, start-<lb/>
ing from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his<lb/>
&#x201C;flurry,&#x201D; the monster horribly wallowed in his blood, over-<lb/>
wrapped himself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that<lb/>
the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado<lb/>
blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the<lb/>
clear air of the day.</p>
<p>And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled<lb/>
out into view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilat-<lb/>
ing and contracting his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, ago-<lb/>
nized respirations. At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore,<lb/>
as if it had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the<lb/>
frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping down his<lb/>
motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;s dead, Mr. Stubb,&#x201D; said Daggoo.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes; both pipes smoked out!&#x201D; and withdrawing his own<lb/>
from his mouth, Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water;<lb/>
and, for a moment, stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he<lb/>
had made.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the dart</hi>.</head>
<p>A <hi rend="sc">word</hi> concerning an incident in the last chapter.</p>
<p>According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-<lb/>
boat pushes off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-<lb/>
killer as temporary steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-<lb/>
fastener pulling the foremost oar, the one known as the<lb/>
harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike<lb/>
the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long<lb/>
dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of<lb/>
twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting<lb/>
the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile<lb/>
to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of<lb/>
superhuman activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing,<lb/>
but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is<lb/>
to keep shouting at the top of one&#x0027;s compass, while all the other<lb/>
muscles are strained and half started&#x2014;what that is none<lb/>
know but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl<lb/>
very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same<lb/>
time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to<lb/>
the fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting<lb/>
cry&#x2014;&#x201C;Stand up, and give it to him!&#x201D; He now has to drop<lb/>
and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his<lb/>
harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may<lb/>
remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No<lb/>
wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out<lb/>
of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder<lb/>
that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and dis-<lb/>
rated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n359" n="322"/>
vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are<lb/>
absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many<lb/>
ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the<lb/>
harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath<lb/>
out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted!</p>
<p>Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical<lb/>
instant, that is, when the whale starts to run, the boat-header<lb/>
and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft, to the im-<lb/>
minent jeopardy of themselves and every one else. It is then<lb/>
they change places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the<lb/>
little craft, takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.</p>
<p>Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is<lb/>
both foolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in<lb/>
the bows from first to last; he should both dart the harpoon<lb/>
and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected of<lb/>
him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I<lb/>
know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in<lb/>
the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more<lb/>
than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of<lb/>
failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much<lb/>
the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the<lb/>
harpooneer that has caused them.</p>
<p>To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers<lb/>
of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and<lb/>
not from out of toil.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d63" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LXIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the crotch</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Out</hi> of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the<lb/>
twigs. So, in productive subjects, grow the chapters.</p>
<pb xml:id="n360" n="323"/>
<p>The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves inde-<lb/>
pendent mention. It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some<lb/>
two feet in length, which is perpendicularly inserted into the<lb/>
starboard gunwale near the bow, for the purpose of furnishing a<lb/>
rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon, whose other<lb/>
naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby<lb/>
the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up<lb/>
as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from<lb/>
the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the<lb/>
crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.</p>
<p>But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both con-<lb/>
nected with the line; the object being this: to dart them both,<lb/>
if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale;<lb/>
so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other<lb/>
may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But<lb/>
it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent,<lb/>
convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it<lb/>
becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in<lb/>
his movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless,<lb/>
as the second iron is already connected with the line, and the line<lb/>
is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be antici-<lb/>
patingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else<lb/>
the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled<lb/>
into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of<lb/>
box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in<lb/>
most instances, prudently practicable. But this critical act is<lb/>
not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casual-<lb/>
ties.</p>
<p>Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is<lb/>
thrown overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-<lb/>
edged terror, skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale,<lb/>
entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a prodigious<lb/>
sensation in all directions. Nor, in general, is it possible to<lb/>
secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.</p>
<pb xml:id="n361" n="324"/>
<p>Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all<lb/>
engaging one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale;<lb/>
when owing to these qualities in him, as well as to the thousand<lb/>
concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten<lb/>
loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him.<lb/>
For, of course, each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend<lb/>
on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted with-<lb/>
out recovery. All these particulars are faithfully narrated here,<lb/>
as they will not fail to elucidate several most important, how-<lb/>
ever intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be painted.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d64" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LXIV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">stubb&#x0027;s supper</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Stubb&#x0027;s</hi> whale had been killed some distance from the ship.<lb/>
It was a calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we com-<lb/>
menced the slow business of towing the trophy to the Pequod.<lb/>
And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and one<lb/>
hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after<lb/>
hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed<lb/>
hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals; good evidence<lb/>
was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we<lb/>
moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever<lb/>
they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will<lb/>
draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but<lb/>
this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden<lb/>
with pig-lead in bulk.</p>
<p>Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pe-<lb/>
quod&#x0027;s main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer<lb/>
we saw Ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the<lb/>
bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment,<lb/>
he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n362" n="325"/>
handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin,<lb/>
and did not come forward again until morning.</p>
<p>Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab<lb/>
had evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that<lb/>
the creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience,<lb/>
or despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead<lb/>
body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and<lb/>
though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all<lb/>
that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.<lb/>
Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the<lb/>
Pequod&#x0027;s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in<lb/>
the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck,<lb/>
and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clank-<lb/>
ing links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored.<lb/>
Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the<lb/>
whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel&#x0027;s, and seen<lb/>
through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars<lb/>
and rigging aloft, the two&#x2014;ship and whale, seemed yoked<lb/>
together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the<lb/>
other remains standing.<note xml:id="fn13-325"><p>A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most<lb/>
reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,<lb/>
is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is rela-<lb/>
tively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even<lb/>
in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so that with the hand<lb/>
you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the chain round it.<lb/>
But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a small, strong line is pre-<lb/>
pared with a wooden float at its outer end, and a weight in its middle,<lb/>
while the other end is secured to the ship. By adroit management the<lb/>
wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now<lb/>
having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit; and<lb/>
being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest<lb/>
part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.</p></note></p>
<p>If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as<lb/>
could be known on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n363" n="326"/>
conquest, betrayed an unusual but still good-natured excite-<lb/>
ment. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid Star-<lb/>
buck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time<lb/>
the sole management of affairs. One small, helping cause of<lb/>
all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest.<lb/>
Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond<lb/>
of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard<lb/>
you go, and cut me one from his small!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not,<lb/>
as a general thing, and according to the great military maxim,<lb/>
make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war (at<lb/>
least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet now and<lb/>
then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine<lb/>
relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale desig-<lb/>
nated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the<lb/>
body.</p>
<p>About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted<lb/>
by two lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his sper-<lb/>
maceti supper at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a<lb/>
sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mas-<lb/>
tications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round<lb/>
the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The<lb/>
few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the<lb/>
sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches<lb/>
of the sleepers&#x0027; hearts. Peering over the side you could just<lb/>
see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen,<lb/>
black waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped<lb/>
out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human<lb/>
head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but miracu-<lb/>
lous. How, at such an apparently unassailable surface, they<lb/>
contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a<lb/>
part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n364" n="327"/>
thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow<lb/>
made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.</p>
<p>Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-<lb/>
fight, sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
decks, like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being<lb/>
carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to<lb/>
them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-<lb/>
table are thus cannibally carving each other&#x0027;s live meat with<lb/>
carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with<lb/>
their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under<lb/>
the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the<lb/>
whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same<lb/>
thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for<lb/>
all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders<lb/>
of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting<lb/>
alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere,<lb/>
or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two<lb/>
other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms,<lb/>
places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate,<lb/>
and most hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or<lb/>
occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers, and<lb/>
in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale,<lb/>
moored by night to a whale-ship at sea. If you have never<lb/>
seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety<lb/>
of devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.</p>
<p>But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet<lb/>
that was going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded<lb/>
the smacking of his own epicurean lips.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cook, cook!&#x2014;where&#x0027;s that old Fleece?&#x201D; he cried at length,<lb/>
widening his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base<lb/>
for his supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the<lb/>
dish, as if stabbing with his lance; &#x201C;cook, you cook!&#x2014;sail this<lb/>
way, cook!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The old black, not in any very high glee at having been pre-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n365" n="328"/>
viously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable<lb/>
hour, came shambling along from his galley, for, like many old<lb/>
blacks, there was something the matter with his knee-pans,<lb/>
which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans; this old<lb/>
Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping along,<lb/>
assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion,<lb/>
were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floun-<lb/>
dered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came<lb/>
to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb&#x0027;s sideboard; when,<lb/>
with both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged<lb/>
cane, he bowed his arched back still further over, at the same<lb/>
time sideways inclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into<lb/>
play.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cook,&#x201D; said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to<lb/>
his mouth, &#x201C;don&#x0027;t you think this steak is rather overdone?<lb/>
You&#x0027;ve been beating this steak too much, cook; it&#x0027;s too tender.<lb/>
Don&#x0027;t I always say that to be good, a whale-steak must be<lb/>
tough? There are those sharks now over the side, don&#x0027;t you<lb/>
see they prefer it tough and rare? What a shindy they are<lb/>
kicking up! Cook, go and talk to &#x0027;em; tell &#x0027;em they are wel-<lb/>
come to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they<lb/>
must keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away,<lb/>
cook, and deliver my message. Here, take this lantern,&#x201D; snatch-<lb/>
ing one from his sideboard; &#x201C;now then, go and preach to<lb/>
&#x0027;em!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across<lb/>
the deck to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping<lb/>
his light low over the sea, so as to get a good view of his con-<lb/>
gregation, with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs,<lb/>
and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began ad-<lb/>
dressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind, over-<lb/>
heard all that was said.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fellow-critters: I&#x0027;se ordered here to say dat you must stop<lb/>
dat dam noise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin&#x0027; ob<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n366" n="329"/>
de lip! Massa Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up<lb/>
to de hatchings, but by Gor! you must stop dat dam racket!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cook,&#x201D; here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with<lb/>
a sudden slap on the shoulder,&#x2014;&#x201C;Cook! why, damn your eyes,<lb/>
you mustn&#x0027;t swear that way when you&#x0027;re preaching. That&#x0027;s no<lb/>
way to convert sinners, Cook!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,&#x201D; sullenly turning<lb/>
to go.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, Cook; go on, go on.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Right!&#x201D; exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, &#x201C;coax &#x0027;em to it; try that,&#x201D; and Fleece continued.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I<lb/>
zay to you, fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness&#x2014;&#x2018;top dat dam<lb/>
slappin&#x2019; ob de tail! How you tink to hear, &#x0027;spose you keep up<lb/>
such a dam slappin&#x0027; and bitin&#x0027; dare?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cook,&#x201D; cried Stubb, collaring him, &#x201C;I wont have that swear-<lb/>
ing. Talk to &#x0027;em gentlemanly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once more the sermon proceeded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don&#x0027;t blame ye so<lb/>
much for; dat is natur, and can&#x0027;t be helped; but to gobern dat<lb/>
wicked natur, dat is de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you<lb/>

not&#x0027;ing more dan de shark well goberned. Now, look here,<lb/>

some o&#x0027; you has berry brig mout, brigger dan oders; but den<lb/>

<pb xml:id="n367" n="330"/>
<p>&#x201C;Well done, old Fleece!&#x201D; cried Stubb, &#x201C;that&#x0027;s Christianity;<lb/>
go on.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No use goin&#x0027; on; de dam willains will keep a scrougin&#x0027; and<lb/>
slappin&#x0027; each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don&#x0027;t hear one word; no<lb/>
use a-preachin&#x0027; to such dam g&#x0027;uttons as you call &#x0027;em, till dare<lb/>

go fast to sleep on de coral, and can&#x0027;t hear not&#x0027;ing at all, no more,<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give<lb/>
the benediction, Fleece, and I&#x0027;ll away to my supper.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob,<lb/>
raised his shrill voice, and cried&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever<lb/>
you can; fill your dam&#x0027; bellies &#x2018;till dey bust&#x2014;and den die.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, cook,&#x201D; said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan;<lb/>
&#x201C;Stand just where you stood before, there, over against me, and<lb/>
pay particular attention.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All dention,&#x201D; said Fleece, again stooping over upon his<lb/>
tongs in the desired position.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; &#x201C;I<lb/>
shall now go back to the subject of this steak. In the first<lb/>
place, how old are you, cook?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What dat do wid de &#x0027;teak,&#x201D; said the old black, testily.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Silence! How old are you, cook?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Bout ninety, dey say,&#x201D; he gloomily muttered.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And have you lived in this world hard upon one hundred<lb/>
years, cook, and don&#x0027;t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?&#x201D;<lb/>
rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word, so that that<lb/>
morsel seemed a continuation of the question. &#x201C;Where were<lb/>
you born, cook?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin&#x0027; ober de Roanoke.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Born in a ferry-boat! That&#x0027;s queer, too. But I want to<lb/>
know what country you were born in, cook?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n368" n="331"/>
<p>&#x201C;Didn&#x0027;t I say de Roanoke country?&#x201D; he cried, sharply.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, you didn&#x0027;t, cook; but I&#x0027;ll tell you what I&#x0027;m coming to,<lb/>
cook. You must go home and be born over again; you don&#x0027;t<lb/>
know how to cook a whale-steak yet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,&#x201D; he growled, angrily, turning round to depart.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come back, cook;&#x2014;here, hand me those tongs;&#x2014;now take<lb/>
that bit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak<lb/>
cooked as it should be? Take it, I say&#x201D;&#x2014;holding the tongs<lb/>
towards him&#x2014;&#x201C;take it, and taste it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the<lb/>
old negro muttered, &#x201C;Best cooked &#x2018;teak I eber taste; joosy,<lb/>
berry joosy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cook,&#x201D; said Stubb, squaring himself once more; &#x201C;do you<lb/>
belong to the church?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Passed one once in Cape-Down,&#x201D; said the old man sul-<lb/>
lenly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And you have once in your life passed a holy church in<lb/>
Cape-Town, where you doubtless overheard a holy parson<lb/>
addressing his hearers as his beloved fellow-creatures, have you,<lb/>
cook! And yet you come here, and tell me such a dreadful<lb/>
lie as you did just now, eh?&#x201D; said Stubb. &#x201C;Where do you<lb/>
expect to go to, cook?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Go to bed berry soon,&#x201D; he mumbled, half-turning as he<lb/>
spoke.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It&#x0027;s an<lb/>
awful question. Now what&#x0027;s your answer?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;When dis old brack man dies,&#x201D; said the negro slowly,<lb/>
changing his whole air and demeanor, &#x201C;he hisself won&#x0027;t go<lb/>
nowhere; but some bressed angel will come and fetch him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched<lb/>
Elijah? And fetch him where?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Up dere,&#x201D; said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his<lb/>
head, and keeping it there very solemnly.</p>
<pb xml:id="n369" n="332"/>
<p>&#x201C;So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you,<lb/>
cook, when you are dead? But don&#x0027;t you know the higher<lb/>
you climb, the colder it gets? Main-top eh?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Didn&#x0027;t say dat t&#x0027;all,&#x201D; said Fleece, again in the sulks.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You said up there, didn&#x0027;t you? and now look yourself, and<lb/>
see where your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect<lb/>
to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber&#x0027;s hole,<lb/>
cook; but, no, no, cook, you don&#x0027;t get there, except you go the<lb/>
regular way, round by the rigging. It&#x0027;s a ticklish business, but<lb/>
must be done, or else it&#x0027;s no go. But none of us are in<lb/>
heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do<lb/>
ye hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t&#x0027;other a&#x0027;top<lb/>
of your heart, when I&#x0027;m giving my orders, cook. What! that<lb/>
your heart, there?&#x2014;that&#x0027;s your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!&#x2014;that&#x0027;s<lb/>
it&#x2014;now you have it. Hold it there now, and pay attention.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All &#x0027;dention,&#x201D; said the old black, with both hands placed as<lb/>
desired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both<lb/>
ears in front at one and the same time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so<lb/>
very bad, that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible;<lb/>
you see that, don&#x0027;t you? Well, for the future, when you cook<lb/>
another whale-steak for my private table here, the capstan,<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing. Hold<lb/>
the steak in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the other;<lb/>
that done, dish it; d&#x0027;ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook,<lb/>
when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get the<lb/>
tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends of<lb/>
the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the<lb/>
mid-watch. D&#x0027;ye hear? away you sail, then.&#x2014;Halloa! stop!<lb/>
make a bow before you go.&#x2014;Avast heaving again! Whale-<lb/>
balls for breakfast&#x2014;don&#x0027;t forget.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n370" n="333"/>
<p>&#x201C;Wish, by gor! whale eat him, &#x0027;stead of him eat whale. I&#x0027;m<lb/>
bressed if he ain&#x0027;t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,&#x201D;<lb/>
muttered the old man, limping away; with which sage ejacu-<lb/>

<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d65" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LXV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the whale as a dish</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">That</hi> mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds<lb/>
his lamp, and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may<lb/>
say; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go<lb/>
a little into the history and philosophy of it.</p>
<p>It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the<lb/>
Right Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and<lb/>
commanded large prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth&#x0027;s<lb/>
time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward<lb/>
for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued<lb/>
porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of whale. Por-<lb/>
poises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The meat<lb/>
is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being<lb/>
well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or<lb/>
veal balls. The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of<lb/>
them. They had a great porpoise grant from the crown.</p>
<p>The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would<lb/>
by all hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much<lb/>
of him; but when you come to sit down before a meat-pie<lb/>
nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your appetite. Only<lb/>
the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of<lb/>
cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidions. We<lb/>
all know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages<lb/>
of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n371" n="334"/>
doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being ex-<lb/>
ceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that<lb/>
certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in<lb/>
Greenland by a whaling vessel&#x2014;that these men actually lived<lb/>
for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had<lb/>
been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the<lb/>
Dutch whalemen these scraps are called &#x201C;fritters;&#x201D; which,<lb/>
indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and<lb/>
smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives&#x0027; dough-nuts<lb/>
or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that<lb/>
the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.</p>
<p>But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is<lb/>
his exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too<lb/>
fat to be delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be<lb/>
as fine eating as the buffalo&#x0027;s (which is esteemed a rare dish),<lb/>
were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti<lb/>
itself, how bland and creamy that is; like the transparent, half-<lb/>
jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its<lb/>
growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter. Ne-<lb/>
vertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into<lb/>
some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long<lb/>
try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to<lb/>
dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry<lb/>
there awhile. Many a good supper have I thus made.</p>
<p>In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted<lb/>
a fine dish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an<lb/>
axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (pre-<lb/>
cisely resembling two large puddings), they are then mixed with<lb/>
flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor some-<lb/>
what resembling calves&#x0027; head, which is quite a dish amongsome<lb/>
epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among<lb/>
the epicures, by continually dining upon calves&#x0027; brains, by and<lb/>
by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to<lb/>
tell a calf&#x0027;s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n372" n="335"/>
uncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young<lb/>
buck with an intelligent looking calf&#x0027;s head before him, is some-<lb/>
how one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks a<lb/>
sort of reproachfully at him, with an &#x201C;Et tu Brute!&#x201D; expression.</p>
<p>It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively<lb/>
unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with<lb/>
abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the con-<lb/>
sideration before mentioned: i. e. that a man should eat a newly<lb/>
murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.<lb/>
But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was<lb/>
regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had<lb/>
been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and<lb/>
he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-<lb/>
market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds<lb/>
staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not<lb/>
that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal&#x0027;s jaw? Cannibals?<lb/>
who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for<lb/>
the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against<lb/>
a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fe-<lb/>
jee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized and<lb/>
enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground and<lb/>
feastest on their bloated livers in thy pat&#x00E9;-de-foie-gras.</p>
<p>But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and<lb/>
that is adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-han-<lb/>
dle, there, my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off<lb/>
that roast beef, what is that handle made of?&#x2014;what but the<lb/>
bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating? And<lb/>
what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat<lb/>
goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what<lb/>
quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of<lb/>
Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only<lb/>
within the last month or two that that society passed a resolu-<lb/>
tion to patronize nothing but steel pens.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXVI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the shark massacre</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">When</hi> in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale,<lb/>
after long and weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it<lb/>
is not, as a general thing at least, customary to proceed at once<lb/>
to the business of cutting him in. For that business is an<lb/>
exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; and<lb/>
requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common<lb/>
usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a&#x0027;lee; and then send<lb/>
every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reserva-<lb/>
tion that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that<lb/>
is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation<lb/>
shall mount the deck to see that all goes well.</p>
<p>But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this<lb/>
plan will not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of<lb/>
sharks gather round the moored carcase, that were he left so<lb/>
for six hours, say, on a stretch, little more than the skeleton<lb/>
would be visible by morning. In most other parts of the<lb/>
ocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound, their<lb/>
wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished, by<lb/>
vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a pro-<lb/>
cedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to<lb/>
tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in<lb/>
the present case with the Pequod&#x0027;s sharks; though, to be sure,<lb/>
any man unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her<lb/>
side that night, would have almost thought the whole round<lb/>
sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks the maggots in it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his<lb/>
supper was concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n374" n="337"/>
a forecastle seaman came on deck, no small excitement was<lb/>
created among the sharks; for immediately suspending the<lb/>
cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so<lb/>
that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these<lb/>
two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an<lb/>
incessant murdering of the sharks,<note xml:id="fn14-337"><p>The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best<lb/>
steel; is about the bigness of a man&#x0027;s spread hand; and in general shape,<lb/>
corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its<lb/>
sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than the<lb/>
lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when<lb/>
being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a<lb/>
stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.</p></note> by striking the keen steel<lb/>
deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in<lb/>
the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the<lb/>
marksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought<lb/>
about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe.<lb/>
They viciously snapped, not only at each other&#x0027;s disembowel-<lb/>
ments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit their own;<lb/>
till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the<lb/>
same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor<lb/>
was this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and<lb/>
ghosts of these creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic<lb/>
vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones, after what<lb/>
might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and<lb/>
hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks<lb/>
almost took poor Queequeg&#x0027;s hand off, when he tried to shut<lb/>
down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg no care what god made him shark,&#x201D; said the<lb/>
savage, agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; &#x201C;wedder<lb/>
Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must<lb/>

<hi rend="sc">cutting in</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed!<lb/>
Ex officio professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen.<lb/>
The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble;<lb/>
every sailor a butcher. You would have thought we were<lb/>
offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.</p>
<p>In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other<lb/>
ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally paint-<lb/>
ed green, and which no single man can possibly lift&#x2014;this vast<lb/>
bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top and firmly<lb/>
lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest point anywhere<lb/>
above a ship&#x0027;s deck. The end of the hawser-like rope winding<lb/>
through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass,<lb/>
and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the<lb/>
whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some<lb/>
one hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in<lb/>
stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed<lb/>
with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the<lb/>
insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-<lb/>
fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the<lb/>
hole, the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew strik-<lb/>
ing up a wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense<lb/>
crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship careens<lb/>
over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of<lb/>
an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods<lb/>
her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans<lb/>
over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is<lb/>
answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at last, a<lb/>
swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n376" n="339"/>
upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle<lb/>
rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular<lb/>
end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes<lb/>
the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped<lb/>
off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped<lb/>
by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the<lb/>
windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in<lb/>
the water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off<lb/>
along the line called the &#x201C;scarf,&#x201D; simultaneously cut by the<lb/>
spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as<lb/>
it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is<lb/>
all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper<lb/>
end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease<lb/>
heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping<lb/>
mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every<lb/>
one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings,<lb/>
else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.</p>
<p>One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long,<lb/>
keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance<lb/>
he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part<lb/>
of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the second<lb/>
alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold<lb/>
upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Where-<lb/>
upon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand<lb/>
off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a<lb/>
few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in<lb/>
twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long<lb/>
upper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready<lb/>
for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and<lb/>
while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the<lb/>
whale, the other is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first<lb/>
strip through the main hatchway right beneath, into an unfur-<lb/>
nished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this twilight apart-<lb/>
ment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n377" n="340"/>
piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And<lb/>
thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering<lb/>
simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers<lb/>
singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing,<lb/>
the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way<lb/>
of assuaging the general friction.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXVIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the blanket</hi>.</head>
<p>I <hi rend="sc">have</hi> given no small attention to that not unvexed subject,<lb/>
the skin of the whale. I have had controversies about it with<lb/>
experienced whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore.<lb/>
My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is only an<lb/>
opinion.</p>
<p>The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale?<lb/>
Already you know what his blubber is. That blubber is some-<lb/>
thing of the consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher,<lb/>
more elastic and compact, and ranges from eight or ten to<lb/>
twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.</p>
<p>Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of<lb/>
any creature&#x0027;s skin as being of that sort of consistence and<lb/>
thickness, yet in point of fact these are no arguments against<lb/>
such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense<lb/>
enveloping layer from the whale&#x0027;s body but that same blubber;<lb/>
and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably<lb/>
dense, what can that be but the skin? True, from the unmarred<lb/>
dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your hand<lb/>
an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling<lb/>
the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and<lb/>
soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n378" n="341"/>
contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I<lb/>
have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-<lb/>
books. It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon<lb/>
the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancy-<lb/>
ing it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant<lb/>
to read about whales through their own spectacles, as you may<lb/>
say. But what I am driving at here is this. That same infi-<lb/>
nitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the<lb/>
entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the<lb/>
skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it<lb/>
were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tre-<lb/>
mendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a<lb/>
new-born child. But no more of this.</p>
<p>Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then,<lb/>
when this skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale,<lb/>
will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it<lb/>
is considered that, in quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its<lb/>
expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire sub-<lb/>
stance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of the enor-<lb/>
mousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere<lb/>
integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning<lb/>
ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of<lb/>
only three quarters of the stuff of the whale&#x0027;s skin.</p>
<p>In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least<lb/>
among the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is<lb/>
all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight<lb/>
marks in thick array, something like those in the finest Italian<lb/>
line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed<lb/>
upon the isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be<lb/>
seen through it, as if they were engraved upon the body itself.<lb/>
Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick, observant eye,<lb/>
those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford the<lb/>
ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical;<lb/>
that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n379" n="342"/>
pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in<lb/>
the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the hiero-<lb/>
glyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much<lb/>
struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chi-<lb/>
selled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the<lb/>
Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-<lb/>
marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian<lb/>
rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the<lb/>
other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale pre-<lb/>
sents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his<lb/>
flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by<lb/>
reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular,<lb/>
random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on<lb/>
the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of<lb/>
violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs&#x2014;I should<lb/>
say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale<lb/>
in this particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in<lb/>
the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other<lb/>
whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full-<lb/>
grown bulls of the species.</p>
<p>A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or<lb/>
blubber of the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript<lb/>
from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-<lb/>
terms, this one is very happy and significant. For the whale is<lb/>
indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counter-<lb/>
pane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and<lb/>
skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing<lb/>
of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself comforta-<lb/>
ble in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would<lb/>
become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy<lb/>
seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True,<lb/>
other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean<lb/>
waters; but these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lung-<lb/>
less fish, whose very bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n380" n="343"/>
warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in<lb/>
winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the<lb/>
whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he<lb/>
dies. How wonderful is it then&#x2014;except after explanation&#x2014;<lb/>
that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indis-<lb/>
pensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be<lb/>
found at home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic<lb/>
waters! where, when seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes<lb/>
found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into the hearts<lb/>
of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more<lb/>
surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that<lb/>
the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo<lb/>
negro in summer.</p>
<p>It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a<lb/>
strong individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls,<lb/>
and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire<lb/>
and model thyself after the whale! Do thou, too, remain<lb/>
warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this world without<lb/>
being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at<lb/>
the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter&#x0027;s, and like the<lb/>
great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature<lb/>
of thine own.</p>
<p>But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things!<lb/>
Of erections, how few are domed like St. Peter&#x0027;s! of creatures,<lb/>
how few vast as the whale!</p>

<p>The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled<lb/>
white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepul-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n381" n="344"/>
chre; though changed in hue, it has not perceptibly lost any-<lb/>
thing in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it floats more and<lb/>
more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the insati-<lb/>
ate sharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of<lb/>
screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many insulting poni-<lb/>
ards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats<lb/>
further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,<lb/>
what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls,<lb/>
augment the murderous din. For hours and hours from the<lb/>
almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the<lb/>
unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair face of the plea-<lb/>
sant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of death<lb/>
floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.</p>
<p>There&#x0027;s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-<lb/>
vultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously<lb/>
in black or speckled. In life but few of them would have helped<lb/>
the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon<lb/>
the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh,<lb/>
horrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest<lb/>
whale is free.</p>
<p>Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful<lb/>
ghost survives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some<lb/>
timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar,<lb/>
when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless<lb/>
still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white<lb/>
spray heaving high against it; straightway the whale&#x0027;s un-<lb/>
harming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the log&#x2014;<lb/>
<hi rend="i">shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!</hi> And for<lb/>
years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it<lb/>
as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader origi-<lb/>
nally leaped there when a stick was held. There&#x0027;s your law of<lb/>
precedents; there&#x0027;s your utility of traditions; there&#x0027;s the story<lb/>
of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the<lb/>
earth, and now not even hovering in the air! There&#x0027;s orthodoxy!</p>
<pb xml:id="n382" n="345"/>
<p>Thus, while in life the great whale&#x0027;s body may have been a<lb/>
real terror to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a power-<lb/>
less panic to a world.</p>
<p>Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other<lb/>
ghosts than the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doc-<lb/>

<hi rend="sc">the sphynx</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> should not have been omitted that previous to completely<lb/>
stripping the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now,<lb/>
the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical<lb/>
feat, upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride<lb/>
themselves: and not without reason.</p>
<p>Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be<lb/>
called a neck; on the contrary, where his head and body seem<lb/>
to join, there, in that very place, is the thickest part of him.<lb/>
Remember, also, that the surgeon must operate from above,<lb/>
some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject,<lb/>
and that subject almost hidden in a discolored, rolling, and<lb/>
oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear in mind, too,<lb/>
that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many<lb/>
feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, with-<lb/>
out so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contract-<lb/>
ing gash thus made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adja-<lb/>
cent, interdicted parts, and exactly divide the spine at a critical<lb/>
point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do you not marvel,<lb/>
then, at Stubb&#x0027;s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to<lb/>
behead a sperm whale?</p>
<p>When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n383" n="346"/>
by a cable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to<lb/>
a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed<lb/>
of. But, with a full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the<lb/>
sperm whale&#x0027;s head embraces nearly one third of his entire<lb/>
bulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as that, even<lb/>
by the immense tackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing<lb/>
as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers&#x0027; scales.</p>
<p>The Pequod&#x0027;s whale being decapitated and the body stripped,<lb/>
the head was hoisted against the ship&#x0027;s side&#x2014;about half way out<lb/>
of the sea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by<lb/>
its native element. And there with the strained craft steeply<lb/>
leaning over to it, by reason of the enormous downward drag<lb/>
from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side<lb/>
projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that blood-drip-<lb/>
ping head hung to the Pequod&#x0027;s waist like the giant Holofernes&#x0027;s<lb/>
from the girdle of Judith.</p>
<p>When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the<lb/>
seamen went below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the<lb/>
before tumultuous but now deserted deck. An intense copper<lb/>
calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more and more unfold-<lb/>
ing its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.</p>
<p>A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came<lb/>
Ahab alone from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-<lb/>
deck, he paused to gaze over the side, then slowly getting into<lb/>
the main-chains he took Stubb&#x0027;s long spade&#x2014;still remaining<lb/>
there after the whale&#x0027;s decapitation&#x2014;and striking it into the<lb/>
lower part of the half-suspended mass, placed its other end<lb/>
crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood leaning over with eyes<lb/>
attentively fixed on this head.</p>
<p>It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the<lb/>
midst of so intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx&#x0027;s in the de-<lb/>
sert. &#x201C;Speak, thou vast and venerable head,&#x201D; muttered Ahab,<lb/>
&#x201C;which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and there<lb/>
lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n384" n="347"/>
secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the<lb/>
deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,<lb/>
has moved amid this world&#x0027;s foundations. Where unrecorded<lb/>
names and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where<lb/>
in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones<lb/>
of millions of the drowned; there, in that awful water-land,<lb/>
there was thy most familiar home. Thou hast been where bell<lb/>
or diver never went; hast slept by many a sailor&#x0027;s side, where<lb/>
sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down.<lb/>
Thou saw&#x0027;st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming<lb/>
ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true<lb/>
to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw&#x0027;st<lb/>
the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck;<lb/>
for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw;<lb/>
and his murderers still sailed on unharmed&#x2014;while swift light-<lb/>
nings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a<lb/>
righteous husband to outstretched, longing arms. O head!<lb/>
thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel<lb/>
of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sail ho!&#x201D; cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-<lb/>
head.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye? Well, now, that&#x0027;s cheering,&#x201D; cried Ahab, suddenly<lb/>
erecting himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from<lb/>
his brow. &#x201C;That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost<lb/>
convert a better man.&#x2014;Where away?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down<lb/>
her breeze to us!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come<lb/>
along that way, and to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O<lb/>
Nature, and O soul of man! how far beyond all utterance are<lb/>

<hi rend="sc">the jeroboam&#x0027;s story</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Hand</hi> in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze<lb/>
came faster than the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.</p>
<p>By and by, through the glass the strangers&#x0027; boats and<lb/>
manned mast-heads proved her a whale-ship. But as she was<lb/>
so far to windward, and shooting by, apparently making a pas-<lb/>
sage to some other ground, the Pequod could not hope to<lb/>
reach her. So the signal was set to see what response would be made.</p>
<p>Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the<lb/>
ships of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal;<lb/>
all which signals being collected in a book with the names of<lb/>
the respective vessels attached, every captain is provided with<lb/>
it. Thereby, the whale commanders are enabled to recognise<lb/>
each other upon the ocean, even at considerable distances, and<lb/>
with no small facility.</p>
<p>The Pequod&#x0027;s signal was at last responded to by the stran-<lb/>
ger&#x0027;s setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jero-<lb/>
boam of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she bore down,<lb/>
ranged abeam under the Pequod&#x0027;s lee, and lowered a boat; it<lb/>
soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by<lb/>
Starbuck&#x0027;s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stran-<lb/>
ger in question waved his hand from his boat&#x0027;s stern in token<lb/>
of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out<lb/>
that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and<lb/>
that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod&#x0027;s<lb/>
company. For, though himself and boat&#x0027;s crew remained un-<lb/>
tainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n386" n="349"/>
incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet con-<lb/>
scientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he<lb/>
peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.</p>
<p>But this did by no means prevent all communication. Pre-<lb/>
serving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship,<lb/>
the Jeroboam&#x0027;s boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived<lb/>
to keep parallel to the Pequod, as she heavily forged through<lb/>
the sea (for by this time it blew very fresh), with her main-top-<lb/>
sail aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a<lb/>
large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead;<lb/>
but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings<lb/>
again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now<lb/>
and then, a conversation was sustained between the two par-<lb/>
ties; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a<lb/>
very different sort.</p>
<p>Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam&#x0027;s boat, was a man of a sin-<lb/>
gular appearance, even in that wild whaling life where indivi-<lb/>
dual notabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short,<lb/>
youngish man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and<lb/>
wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-<lb/>
cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlap-<lb/>
ping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A deep,<lb/>
settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.</p>
<p>So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had ex-<lb/>
claimed&#x2014;&#x201C;That&#x0027;s he! that&#x0027;s he!&#x2014;the long-togged scaramouch<lb/>
the Town-Ho&#x0027;s company told us of!&#x201D; Stubb here alluded to<lb/>
a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among<lb/>
her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the<lb/>
Town-Ho. According to this account and what was subse-<lb/>
quently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in question had<lb/>
gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the<lb/>
Jeroboam. His story was this:</p>
<p>He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n387" n="350"/>
Neskyeuna Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in<lb/>
their cracked, secret meetings having several times descended<lb/>
from heaven by the way of a trap-door, announcing the speedy<lb/>
opening of the seventh vial, which he carried in his vest-pocket;<lb/>
but, which, instead of containing gunpowder, was supposed to<lb/>
be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having<lb/>
seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with<lb/>
that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, com-<lb/>
mon sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candi-<lb/>
date for the Jeroboam&#x0027;s whaling voyage. They engaged him;<lb/>
but straightway upon the ship&#x0027;s getting out of sight of land, his<lb/>
insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself as the<lb/>
archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump over-<lb/>
board. He published his manifesto, whereby he set himself<lb/>
forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general<lb/>
of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which he<lb/>
declared these things;&#x2014;the dark, daring play of his sleepless,<lb/>
excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real<lb/>
delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the ma-<lb/>
jority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness.<lb/>
Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however,<lb/>
was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he<lb/>
refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous cap-<lb/>
tain would fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that<lb/>
individual&#x0027;s intention was to land him in the first convenient<lb/>
port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials&#x2014;<lb/>
devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in<lb/>
case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work<lb/>
upon his disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they<lb/>
went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the<lb/>
ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore<lb/>
forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel<lb/>
to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it<lb/>
came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n388" n="351"/>
ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared<lb/>
little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epi-<lb/>
demic had broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever;<lb/>
declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole com-<lb/>
mand; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleas-<lb/>
ure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of<lb/>
them fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions, some-<lb/>
times rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such<lb/>
things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are<lb/>
true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect<lb/>
to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his<lb/>
measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.<lb/>
But it is time to return to the Pequod.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I fear not thy epidemic, man,&#x201D; said Ahab from the bul-<lb/>
warks, to Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat&#x0027;s stern;<lb/>
&#x201C;come on board.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But now Gabriel started to his feet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware<lb/>
of the horrible plague!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gabriel, Gabriel!&#x201D; cried Captain Mayhew; &#x201C;thou must<lb/>
either&#x2014;&#x201D; But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far<lb/>
ahead, and its seethings drowned all speech.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hast thou seen the White Whale?&#x201D; demanded Ahab, when<lb/>
the boat drifted back.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware<lb/>
of the horrible tail!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I tell thee again, Gabriel, that&#x2014;&#x201D; But again the boat<lb/>
tore ahead as if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some<lb/>
moments, while a succession of riotous waves rolled by, which<lb/>
by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling,<lb/>
not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale&#x0027;s head<lb/>
jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it<lb/>
with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature<lb/>
seemed to warrant.</p>
<pb xml:id="n389" n="352"/>
<p>When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark<lb/>
story concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent<lb/>
interruptions from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned,<lb/>
and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him.</p>
<p>It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when<lb/>
upon speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised<lb/>
of the existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.<lb/>
Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned<lb/>
the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the<lb/>
monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing<lb/>
the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God<lb/>
incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some<lb/>
year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the<lb/>
mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to en-<lb/>
counter him; and the captain himself being not unwilling to<lb/>
let him have the opportunity, despite all the archangel&#x0027;s denun-<lb/>
ciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five<lb/>
men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after<lb/>
much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he<lb/>
at last succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel,<lb/>
ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm<lb/>
in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom<lb/>
to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while Macey,<lb/>
the mate, was standing up in his boat&#x0027;s bow, and with all the<lb/>
reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations<lb/>
upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised<lb/>
lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick,<lb/>
fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies<lb/>
of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of<lb/>
furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a<lb/>
long arc in his descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about<lb/>
fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of<lb/>
any oarsman&#x0027;s head; but the mate for ever sank.</p>
<p>It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n390" n="353"/>
the Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as fre-<lb/>
quent as any. Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who<lb/>
is thus annihilated; oftener the boat&#x0027;s bow is knocked off, or<lb/>
the thigh-board, in which the headsman stands, is torn from its<lb/>
place and accompanies the body. But strangest of all is the<lb/>
circumstance, that in more instances than one, when the body<lb/>
has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is discernible;<lb/>
the man being stark dead.</p>
<p>The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was<lb/>
plainly descried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;The vial! the vial!&#x201D; Gabriel called off the terror-stricken<lb/>
crew from the further hunting of the whale. This terrible<lb/>
event clothed the archangel with added influence; because his<lb/>
credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore-<lb/>
announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which<lb/>
any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of<lb/>
many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a name-<lb/>
less terror to the ship.</p>
<p>Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such<lb/>
questions to him, that the stranger captain could not forbear<lb/>
inquiring whether he intended to hunt the White Whale, if oppor-<lb/>
tunity should offer. To which Ahab answered&#x2014;&#x201C;Aye.&#x201D;<lb/>
Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his feet, glaring<lb/>
upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward<lb/>
pointed finger&#x2014;&#x201C;Think, think of the blasphemer&#x2014;dead, and<lb/>
down there!&#x2014;beware of the blasphemer&#x0027;s end!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, &#x201C;Captain, I<lb/>
have just bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for<lb/>
one of thy officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the<lb/>
bag.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for<lb/>
various ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may<lb/>
be addressed, depends upon the mere chance of encountering<lb/>
them in the four oceans. Thus, most letters never reach their<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n391" n="354"/>
mark; and many are only received after attaining an age of<lb/>
two or three years or more.</p>
<p>Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was<lb/>
sorely tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green<lb/>
mould, in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the<lb/>
cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself might well have been<lb/>
the post-boy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can&#x0027;st not read it?&#x201D; cried Ahab. &#x201C;Give it me, man. Aye,<lb/>
aye, it&#x0027;s but a dim scrawl;&#x2014;what&#x0027;s this?&#x201D; As he was studying<lb/>
it out, Starbuck took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his<lb/>
knife slightly split the end, to insert the letter there, and in<lb/>
that way, hand it to the boat, without its coming any closer to<lb/>
the ship.</p>
<p>Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, &#x201C;Mr. Har&#x2014;<lb/>
yes, Mr. Harry&#x2014;(a woman&#x0027;s pinny hand,&#x2014;the man&#x0027;s wife, I&#x0027;ll<lb/>
wager)&#x2014;Aye&#x2014;Mr. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;&#x2014;why it&#x0027;s<lb/>
Macey, and he&#x0027;s dead!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,&#x201D; sighed<lb/>
Mayhew; &#x201C;but let me have it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nay, keep it thyself,&#x201D; cried Gabriel to Ahab; &#x201C;thou art<lb/>
soon going that way.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Curses throttle thee!&#x201D; yelled Ahab. &#x201C;Captain Mayhew,<lb/>
stand by now to receive it;&#x201D; and taking the fatal missive from<lb/>
Starbuck&#x0027;s hands, he caught it in the slit of the pole, and<lb/>
reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so, the oars-<lb/>
men expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little<lb/>
towards the ship&#x0027;s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter sud-<lb/>
denly ranged along with Gabriel&#x0027;s eager hand. He clutched it<lb/>
in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it,<lb/>
sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab&#x0027;s feet.<lb/>
Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with<lb/>
their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot<lb/>
away from the Pequod.</p>
<p>As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n392" n="355"/>
the jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in<lb/>
reference to this wild affair.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d72" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LXXII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the monkey-rope</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">In</hi> the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a<lb/>
whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the<lb/>
crew. Now hands are<lb/>
wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one<lb/>
and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It<lb/>
is much the same with him who endeavors the description of<lb/>
the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was men-<lb/>
tioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale&#x0027;s back, the<lb/>
blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by<lb/>
the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty<lb/>
a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was<lb/>
inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it<lb/>
was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster&#x0027;s back for the<lb/>
special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circum-<lb/>
stances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale<lb/>
till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The<lb/>
whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting<lb/>
the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten<lb/>
feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders<lb/>
about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast<lb/>
mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion<lb/>
in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume&#x2014;a shirt<lb/>
and socks&#x2014;in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to un-<lb/>
common advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe<lb/>
him, as will presently be seen.</p>
<p>Being the savage&#x0027;s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n393" n="356"/>
the bow-oar in his boat (the second one from forward), it was<lb/>
my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hard-<lb/>
scrabble scramble upon the dead whale&#x0027;s back. You have seen<lb/>
Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord.<lb/>
Just so, from the ship&#x0027;s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down<lb/>
there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a<lb/>
monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round<lb/>
his waist.</p>
<p>It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For,<lb/>
before we proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope<lb/>
was fast at both ends; fast to Queequeg&#x0027;s broad canvas belt,<lb/>
and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for better or for<lb/>
worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor<lb/>
Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor<lb/>
demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me<lb/>
down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature<lb/>
united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother;<lb/>
nor could I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which<lb/>
the hempen bond entailed.</p>
<p>So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situa-<lb/>
tion then, that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed<lb/>
distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now<lb/>
merged in a joint stock company of two: that my free will had<lb/>
received a mortal wound; and that another&#x0027;s mistake or mis-<lb/>
fortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and<lb/>
death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in<lb/>
Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have sanc-<lb/>
tioned so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering&#x2014;<lb/>
while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and<lb/>
the ship, which would threaten to jam him&#x2014;still further pon-<lb/>
dering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine was the precise<lb/>
situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases, he,<lb/>
one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality<lb/>
of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n394" n="357"/>
apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die.<lb/>
True, you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly<lb/>
escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life.<lb/>
But handle Queequeg&#x0027;s monkey-rope heedfully as I would,<lb/>
sometimes he jerked it so, that I came very near sliding over-<lb/>
board. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I would, I<lb/>
only had the management of one end of it.<note xml:id="fn15-357"><p>The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the<lb/>
Pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This<lb/>
improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man<lb/>
than Stubb, in order to afford to the imperilled harpooneer the strongest<lb/>
possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope<lb/>
holder.</p></note></p>
<p>I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from<lb/>
between the whale and the ship&#x2014;where he would occasionally<lb/>
fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this<lb/>
was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unap-<lb/>
palled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the<lb/>
sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent<lb/>
blood which began to flow from the carcase&#x2014;the rabid crea-<lb/>
tures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.</p>
<p>And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often<lb/>
pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing alto-<lb/>
gether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a<lb/>
dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will<lb/>
seldom touch a man.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have<lb/>
such a ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look<lb/>
sharp to them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with<lb/>
which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a<lb/>
vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly fero-<lb/>
cious shark&#x2014;he was provided with still another protection.<lb/>
Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and<lb/>
Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n395" n="358"/>
whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as<lb/>
they could reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was<lb/>
very disinterested and benevolent of them. They meant Quee-<lb/>
queg&#x0027;s best happiness, I admit; but in their hasty zeal to be-<lb/>
friend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the<lb/>
sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-mudded water,<lb/>
those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating<lb/>
a leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and<lb/>
gasping there with that great iron hook&#x2014;poor Queequeg, I<lb/>
suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the<lb/>
hands of his gods.</p>
<p>Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as<lb/>
I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the<lb/>
sea&#x2014;what matters it, after all? Are you not the precious<lb/>
image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That<lb/>
unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes;<lb/>
those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and<lb/>
spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.</p>
<p>But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg.<lb/>
For now, as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted<lb/>
savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and<lb/>
involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward advances,<lb/>
and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him&#x2014;what?<lb/>
Some hot Cogniac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a<lb/>
cup of tepid ginger and water!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ginger? Do I smell ginger?&#x201D; suspiciously asked Stubb,<lb/>
coming near. &#x201C;Yes, this must be ginger,&#x201D; peering into the as<lb/>
yet untasted cup. Then standing as if incredulous for a while,<lb/>
he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly say-<lb/>
ing, &#x201C;Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell<lb/>
me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger!<lb/>
is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-Boy, to kindle a fire<lb/>
in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!&#x2014;what the devil is gin-<lb/>
ger?&#x2014;sea-coal?&#x2014;fire-wood?&#x2014;lucifer matches?&#x2014;tinder?&#x2014;gun-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n396" n="359"/>
powder?&#x2014;what the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this<lb/>
cup to our poor Queequeg here?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement<lb/>
about this business,&#x201D; he suddenly added, now approaching Star-<lb/>
buck, who had just come from forward. &#x201C;Will you look at<lb/>
that kannakin, sir: smell of it, if you please.&#x201D; Then watch-<lb/>
ing the mate&#x0027;s countenance, he added: &#x201C;The steward, Mr.<lb/>
Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Quee-<lb/>
queg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an<lb/>
apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bit-<lb/>
ters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I trust not,&#x201D; said Starbuck, &#x201C;it is poor stuff enough.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, steward,&#x201D; cried Stubb, &#x201C;we&#x0027;ll teach you to drug a<lb/>
harpooneer; none of your apothecary&#x0027;s medicine here; you<lb/>
want to poison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our<lb/>
lives and want to murder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do<lb/>
ye?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was not me,&#x201D; cried Dough-Boy, &#x201C;it was Aunt Charity<lb/>
that brought the ginger on board; and bade me never give the<lb/>
harpooneers any spirits, but only this ginger-jub&#x2014;so she call<lb/>
d it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along<lb/>
with ye to the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do<lb/>
no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is the captain&#x0027;s orders&#x2014;grog for<lb/>
the harpooneer on a whale.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Enough,&#x201D; replied Starbuck, &#x201C;only don&#x0027;t hit him again,<lb/>
but&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or<lb/>
something of that sort; and this fellow&#x0027;s a weazel. What were<lb/>
you about saying, sir?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest<lb/>
thyself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one<lb/>
hand, and a sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n397" n="360"/>
strong spirits, and was handed to Queequeg; the second was<lb/>
Aunt Charity&#x0027;s gift, and that was freely given to the waves.</p>

<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d73" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER LXXIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">stubb and flask kill a right whale; and then have a<lb/>
talk over him</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm<lb/>
Whale&#x0027;s prodigious head hanging to the Pequod&#x0027;s side. But<lb/>
we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a<lb/>
chance to attend to it. For the present other matters press, and<lb/>
the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the<lb/>
tackles may hold.</p>
<p>Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had<lb/>
gradually drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of<lb/>
yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales,<lb/>
a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this<lb/>
particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands<lb/>
commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and<lb/>
though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at<lb/>
all, and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts<lb/>
without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had<lb/>
been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the<lb/>
announcement was made that a Right Whale should be cap-<lb/>
tured that day, if opportunity offered.</p>
<p>Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward;<lb/>
and two boats, Stubb&#x0027;s and Flask&#x0027;s, were detached in pursuit.<lb/>
Pulling further and further away, they at last became almost<lb/>
invisible to the men at the mast-head. But suddenly in the<lb/>
distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and<lb/>
soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n398" n="361"/>
be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in plain sight,<lb/>
in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the tow-<lb/>
ing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at<lb/>
first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going<lb/>
down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he<lb/>
wholly disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel.<lb/>
&#x201C;Cut, cut!&#x201D; was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for<lb/>
one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly<lb/>
dash against the vessel&#x0027;s side. But having plenty of line yet<lb/>
in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid<lb/>
out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all<lb/>
their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes<lb/>
the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked<lb/>
out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars<lb/>
in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under.<lb/>
But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And<lb/>
they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift<lb/>
tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the<lb/>
strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view<lb/>
under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its<lb/>
drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the<lb/>
water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more<lb/>
the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his<lb/>
speed, and blindly altering his course, went round the stern<lb/>
of the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they per-<lb/>
formed a complete circuit.</p>
<p>Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, tili<lb/>
close flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with<lb/>
lance for lance; and thus round and round the Pequod the<lb/>
battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum<lb/>
round the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s body, rushed to the fresh blood that<lb/>
was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager<lb/>
Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the<lb/>
smitten rock.</p>
<pb xml:id="n399" n="362"/>
<p>At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and<lb/>
vomit, he turned upon his back a corpse.</p>
<p>While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords<lb/>
to his flukes, and in other ways getting the mass in readiness<lb/>
for towing, some conversation ensued between them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,&#x201D;<lb/>
said Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having<lb/>
to do with so ignoble a leviathan.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wants with it?&#x201D; said Flask, coiling some spare line in the<lb/>
boat&#x0027;s bow, &#x201C;did you never hear that the ship which but once<lb/>
has a Sperm Whale&#x0027;s head hoisted on her starboard side, and<lb/>
at the same time a Right Whale&#x0027;s on the larboard; did you<lb/>
never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why not?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah<lb/>
saying so, and he seems to know all about ships&#x0027; charms. But I<lb/>
sometimes think he&#x0027;ll charm the ship to no good at last. I<lb/>
don&#x0027;t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that<lb/>
tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake&#x0027;s head, Stubb?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a<lb/>
chance of a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks,<lb/>
and no one by; look down there, Flask&#x201D;&#x2014;pointing into the sea<lb/>
with a peculiar motion of both hands&#x2014;&#x201C;Aye, will I! Flask, I<lb/>
take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise. Do you believe<lb/>
that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on<lb/>
board ship? He&#x0027;s the devil, I say. The reason why you don&#x0027;t<lb/>
see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries it<lb/>
coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I<lb/>
think of it, he&#x0027;s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes<lb/>
of his boots.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He sleeps in his boots, don&#x0027;t he? He hasn&#x0027;t got any ham-<lb/>
mock; but I&#x0027;ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rig-<lb/>
ging.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n400" n="363"/>
<p>&#x201C;No doubt, and it&#x0027;s because of his cursed tail; he coils it<lb/>
down, do ye see, in the eye of the rigging.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s the old man have so much to do with him for?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bargain?&#x2014;about what?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White<lb/>
Whale, and the devil there is trying to come round him, and<lb/>
get him to swap away his silver watch, or his soul, or something<lb/>
of that sort, and then he&#x0027;ll surrender Moby Dick.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do<lb/>
that?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a<lb/>
wicked one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a saun-<lb/>
tering into the old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish<lb/>
easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at<lb/>
home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he<lb/>
wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, &#x2018;I want<lb/>
John.&#x2019; &#x2018;What for?&#x2019; says the old governor. &#x2018;What business is<lb/>
that of yours,&#x2019; says the devil, getting mad,&#x2014;&#x2018;I want to use him.&#x2019;<lb/>
&#x2018;Take him,&#x2019; says the governor&#x2014;and by the Lord, Flask, if the<lb/>
devil didn&#x0027;t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through<lb/>
with him, I&#x0027;ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp<lb/>
&#x2014;aint you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let&#x0027;s<lb/>
get the whale alongside.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I think I remember some such story as you were telling,&#x201D;<lb/>
said Flask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing<lb/>
with their burden towards the ship, &#x201C;but I can&#x0027;t remember<lb/>
where.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-<lb/>
minded soldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye<lb/>
did?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But<lb/>
now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n401" n="364"/>
speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the<lb/>
Pequod?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn&#x0027;t<lb/>
the devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead?<lb/>
Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil?<lb/>
And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral&#x0027;s cabin,<lb/>
don&#x0027;t you suppose he can crawl into a port-hole? Tell me that,<lb/>
Mr. Flask?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you see that mainmast there?&#x201D; pointing to the ship;<lb/>
&#x201C;well, that&#x0027;s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the<lb/>
Pequod&#x0027;s hold, and string &#x0027;em along in a row with that mast,<lb/>
for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn&#x0027;t begin to be Fedal-<lb/>
lah&#x0027;s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn&#x0027;t show hoops<lb/>
enough to make oughts enough.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just<lb/>
now, that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a<lb/>
good chance. Now, if he&#x0027;s so old as all those hoops of yours<lb/>
come to, and if he is going to live for ever, what good will it do<lb/>
to pitch him overboard&#x2014;tell me that?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Give him a good ducking, anyhow.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But he&#x0027;d crawl back.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Duck him again; and keep ducking him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you,<lb/>
though&#x2014;yes, and drown you&#x2014;what then?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I should like to see him try it; I&#x0027;d give him such a pair of<lb/>
black eyes that he wouldn&#x0027;t dare to show his face in the admi-<lb/>
ral&#x0027;s cabin again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop<lb/>
there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where<lb/>
he sneaks so much. Damn the devil, Flask; do you suppose<lb/>
I&#x0027;m afraid of the devil? Who&#x0027;s afraid of him, except the old<lb/>
governor who daresn&#x0027;t catch him and put him in double-darbies,<lb/>
as he deserves, but let&#x0027;s him go about kidnapping people; aye,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n402" n="365"/>
and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil kid-<lb/>
napped, he&#x0027;d roast for him? There&#x0027;s a governor!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do I suppose it? You&#x0027;ll know it before long, Flask. But<lb/>
I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see<lb/>
anything very suspicious going on, I&#x0027;ll just take him by the<lb/>
nape of his neck, and say&#x2014;Look here, Beelzebub, you don&#x0027;t do<lb/>
it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I&#x0027;ll make a grab into<lb/>
his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such<lb/>
a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the<lb/>
stump&#x2014;do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he&#x0027;ll sneak off without the<lb/>
poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;&#x2014;<lb/>
what else?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all<lb/>
along, Stubb?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard<lb/>
side, where fluke chains and other necessaries were already pre-<lb/>
pared for securing him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Didn&#x0027;t I tell you so?&#x201D; said Flask; &#x201C;yes, you&#x0027;ll soon see this<lb/>
right whale&#x0027;s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti&#x0027;s.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In good time, Flask&#x0027;s saying proved true. As before, the<lb/>
Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale&#x0027;s head,<lb/>
now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even<lb/>
keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when<lb/>
on one side you hoist in Locke&#x0027;s head, you go over that way;<lb/>
but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant&#x0027;s and you come back<lb/>
again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever<lb/>
keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-<lb/>
heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.</p>
<p>In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n403" n="366"/>
alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly<lb/>
take place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter<lb/>
instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips<lb/>
and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with<lb/>
all the well known black bone attached to what is called the<lb/>
crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case, had<lb/>
been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;<lb/>
and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying<lb/>
a pair of overburdening panniers.</p>
<p>Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale&#x0027;s head,<lb/>
and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the<lb/>
lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that<lb/>
the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee&#x0027;s shadow<lb/>
was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were<lb/>
bandied among them, concerning all these passing things.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXXIV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the sperm whale&#x0027;s head&#x2014;contrasted view</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Here</hi>, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together;<lb/>
let us join them, and lay together our own.</p>
<p>Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and<lb/>
the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the<lb/>
only whales regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer,<lb/>
they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the<lb/>
whale. As the external difference between them is mainly<lb/>
observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment<lb/>
hanging from the Pequod&#x0027;s side; and as we may freely go from<lb/>
one to the other, by merely stepping across the deck:&#x2014;where,<lb/>
I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to study<lb/>
practical cetology than here?</p>
<pb xml:id="n404" n="367"/>
<p>In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast<lb/>
between these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience;<lb/>
but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm<lb/>
Whale&#x0027;s which the Right Whale&#x0027;s sadly lacks. There is more<lb/>
character in the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s head. As you behold it, you<lb/>
involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point<lb/>
of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity<lb/>
is heightened by the pepper and salt color of his head at the<lb/>
summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience.<lb/>
In short, he is what the fishermen technically call a &#x201C;grey-<lb/>
headed whale.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads&#x2014;<lb/>
namely, the two most important organs, the eye and the ear.<lb/>
Far back on the side of the head, and low down, near the angle<lb/>
of either whale&#x0027;s jaw, if you narrowly search, you will at last see<lb/>
a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt&#x0027;s eye;<lb/>
so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head.</p>
<p>Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale&#x0027;s eyes,<lb/>
it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead,<lb/>
no more than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the posi-<lb/>
tion of the whale&#x0027;s eyes corresponds to that of a man&#x0027;s ears;<lb/>
and you may fancy, for yourself, how it would fare with you,<lb/>
did you sideways survey objects through your ears. You would<lb/>
find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision<lb/>
in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty<lb/>
more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight<lb/>
towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not<lb/>
be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you<lb/>
from behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to<lb/>
speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for<lb/>
what is it that makes the front of a man&#x2014;what, indeed, but his<lb/>
eyes?</p>
<p>Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think<lb/>
of, the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual<lb/>
power, so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n405" n="368"/>
the peculiar position of the whale&#x0027;s eyes, effectually divided as<lb/>
they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers between<lb/>
them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this,<lb/>
of course, must wholly separate the impressions which each<lb/>
independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see<lb/>
one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on<lb/>
that side; while all between must be profound darkness and<lb/>
nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on<lb/>
the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his<lb/>
window. But with the whale, these two sashes are separately<lb/>
inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the<lb/>
view. This peculiarity of the whale&#x0027;s eyes is a thing always to<lb/>
be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the<lb/>
reader in some subsequent scenes.</p>
<p>A curious and most puzzling question might be started con-<lb/>
cerning this visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I<lb/>
must be content with a hint. So long as a man&#x0027;s eyes are open<lb/>
in the light, the act of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot<lb/>
then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him.<lb/>
Nevertheless, any one&#x0027;s experience will teach him, that though he<lb/>
can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance,<lb/>
it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to<lb/>
examine any two things&#x2014;however large or however small&#x2014;at<lb/>
one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side<lb/>
by side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate<lb/>
these two objects, and surround each by a circle of profound<lb/>
darkness; then, in order to see one of them, in such a manner<lb/>
as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other will be utterly<lb/>
excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,<lb/>
then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must<lb/>
simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehen-<lb/>
sive, combining, and subtle than man&#x0027;s, that he can at the same<lb/>
moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one<lb/>
on one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direc-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n406" n="369"/>
tion? If he can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if<lb/>
a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstra-<lb/>
tions of two distinct problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly inves-<lb/>
tigated, is there any incongruity in this comparison.</p>
<p>It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me,<lb/>
that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by<lb/>
some whales when beset by three or four boats; the timidity<lb/>
and liability to queer frights, so common to such whales; I think<lb/>
that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of<lb/>
volition, in which their divided and diametrically opposite<lb/>
powers of vision must involve them.</p>
<p>But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you<lb/>
are an entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these<lb/>
two heads for hours, and never discover that organ. The ear<lb/>
has no external leaf whatever; and into the hole itself you<lb/>
can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. It is<lb/>
lodged a little behind the eye. With respect to their ears, this<lb/>
important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale<lb/>
and the right. While the ear of the former has an external<lb/>
opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over<lb/>
with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.</p>
<p>Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should<lb/>
see the world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder<lb/>
through an ear which is smaller than a hare&#x0027;s? But if his eyes<lb/>
were broad as the lens of Herschel&#x0027;s great telescope; and his<lb/>
ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make<lb/>
him any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.&#x2014;<lb/>
Why then do you try to &#x201C;enlarge&#x201D; your mind? Subtilize it.</p>
<p>Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have<lb/>
at hand, cant over the sperm whale&#x0027;s head, so that it may lie<lb/>
bottom up; then, ascending by a ladder to the summit, have a<lb/>
peep down the mouth; and were it not that the body is now<lb/>
completely separated from it, with a lantern we might descend<lb/>
into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n407" n="370"/>
let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we<lb/>
are. What a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from<lb/>
floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening white<lb/>
membrane, glossy as bridal satins.</p>
<p>But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw,<lb/>
which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box,<lb/>
with the hinge at one end, instead of one side. If you pry it<lb/>
up, so as to get it overhead, and expose its rows of teeth, it<lb/>
seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a<lb/>
poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with im-<lb/>
paling force. But far more terrible is it to behold, when<lb/>
fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating<lb/>
there suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long,<lb/>
hanging straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the<lb/>
world like a ship&#x0027;s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is<lb/>
only dispirited; out of sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so<lb/>
supine, that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed, leaving him<lb/>
there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all his tribe,<lb/>
who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.</p>
<p>In most cases this lower jaw&#x2014;being easily unhinged by a<lb/>
practised artist&#x2014;is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the pur-<lb/>
pose of extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of<lb/>
that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion<lb/>
all sorts of curious articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks,<lb/>
and handles to riding-whips.</p>
<p>With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it<lb/>
were an anchor; and when the proper time comes&#x2014;some few<lb/>
days after the other work&#x2014;Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego,<lb/>
being all accomplished dentists, are set to drawing teeth. With<lb/>
a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw<lb/>
is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being rigged from<lb/>
aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag stumps<lb/>
of old oaks out of wild wood-lands. There are generally forty-<lb/>
two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but unde-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n408" n="371"/>
cayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is after-<lb/>
wards sawn into slabs, and piled away like joists for building<lb/>
houses.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the right whale&#x0027;s head.&#x2014;contrasted view</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Crossing</hi> the deck, let us now have a good long look at the<lb/>
Right Whale&#x0027;s head.</p>
<p>As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale&#x0027;s head may be<lb/>
compared to a Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it<lb/>
is so broadly rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-<lb/>
oed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager<lb/>
likened its shape to that of a shoemaker&#x0027;s last. And in this<lb/>
same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with the<lb/>
swarming brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and<lb/>
all her progeny.</p>
<p>But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to<lb/>
assume different aspects, according to your point of view. If<lb/>
you stand on its summit and look at these two <hi rend="i">f</hi>-shaped spout-<lb/>
holes, you would take the whole head for an enormous bass-<lb/>
viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its sounding-board.<lb/>
Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested,<lb/>
comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass&#x2014;this green,<lb/>
barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the &#x201C;crown,&#x201D;<lb/>
and the Southern fishers the &#x201C;bonnet&#x201D; of the Right Whale;<lb/>
fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the<lb/>
trunk of some huge oak, with a bird&#x0027;s nest in its crotch. At<lb/>
any rate, when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on<lb/>
this bonnet, such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you;<lb/>
unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the technical term<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n409" n="372"/>
&#x201C;crown&#x201D; also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take<lb/>
great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a<lb/>
diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put<lb/>
together for him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale<lb/>
be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem.<lb/>
Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is<lb/>
there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter&#x0027;s measurement, about<lb/>
twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout that will<lb/>
yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.</p>
<p>A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be<lb/>
hare-lipped. The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the<lb/>
mother during an important interval was sailing down the<lb/>
Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the beach to gape.<lb/>
Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the<lb/>
mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take<lb/>
this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is<lb/>
this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet<lb/>
high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regu-<lb/>
lar ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides,<lb/>
present us with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped<lb/>
slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a side, which depend-<lb/>
ing from the upper part of the head or crown bone, form those<lb/>
Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned.<lb/>
The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres,<lb/>
through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose<lb/>
intricacies he retains the small fish, when open-mouthed he<lb/>
goes through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central<lb/>
blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are<lb/>
certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some<lb/>
whalemen calculate the creature&#x0027;s age, as the age of an oak by<lb/>
its circular rings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far<lb/>
from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of analogical probab-<lb/>
ility. At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant a far<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n410" n="373"/>
greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem<lb/>
reasonable.</p>
<p>In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious<lb/>
fancies concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls<lb/>
them the wondrous &#x201C;whiskers&#x201D; inside of the whale&#x0027;s mouth;<note xml:id="fn16-373"><p>This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker,<lb/>
or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the<lb/>
upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts im-<lb/>
part a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance.</p></note><lb/>
another, &#x201C;hogs&#x0027; bristles;&#x201D; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses<lb/>
the following elegant language: &#x201C;There are about two hundred<lb/>
and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper <hi rend="i">chop</hi>, which arch<lb/>
over his tongue on each side of his mouth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As every one knows, these same &#x201C;hogs&#x0027; bristles,&#x201D; &#x201C;fins,&#x201D; &#x201C;<lb/>
hiskers,&#x201D; &#x201C;blinds,&#x201D; or whatever you please, furnish to the la-<lb/>
dies their busks and other stiffening contrivances. But in this<lb/>
particular, the demand has long been on the decline. It was in<lb/>
Queen Anne&#x0027;s time that the bone was in its glory, the farthin-<lb/>
gale being then all the fashion. And as those ancient dames<lb/>
moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as you<lb/>
may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do<lb/>
we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the um-<lb/>
brella being a tent spread over the same bone.</p>
<p>But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment,<lb/>
and, standing in the Right Whale&#x0027;s mouth, look around you<lb/>
afresh. Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically<lb/>
ranged about, would you not think you were inside of the great<lb/>
Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a<lb/>
carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey&#x2014;the<lb/>
tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth.<lb/>
It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it<lb/>
on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing<lb/>
glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield<lb/>
you about that amount of oil.</p>
<pb xml:id="n411" n="374"/>
<p>Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I<lb/>
started with&#x2014;that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have<lb/>
almost entirely different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right<lb/>
Whale&#x0027;s there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all;<lb/>
no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s.<lb/>
Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone;<lb/>
no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again,<lb/>
the Right Whale<lb/>
has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.</p>
<p>Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while<lb/>
they yet lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea;<lb/>
the other will not be very long in following.</p>
<p>Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s there?<lb/>
It is the same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in<lb/>
the forehead seem now faded away. I think his broad brow to<lb/>
be full of a prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indiffe-<lb/>
rence as to death. But mark the other head&#x0027;s expression. See<lb/>
that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel&#x0027;s<lb/>
side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head<lb/>
seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing<lb/>
death? This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the<lb/>
Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza<lb/>
in his latter years.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the battering-ram</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Ere</hi> quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s head, I would<lb/>
have you, as a sensible physiologist, simply&#x2014;particularly remark<lb/>
its front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would<lb/>
have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n412" n="375"/>
yourself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever<lb/>
battering-ram power may be lodged there. Here is a vital<lb/>
point; for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with<lb/>
yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most<lb/>
appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be<lb/>
found in all recorded history.</p>
<p>You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the<lb/>
Sperm Whale, the front of his head presents an almost wholly<lb/>
vertical plane to the water; you observe that the lower part of<lb/>
that front slopes considerably backwards, so as to furnish more<lb/>
of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like<lb/>
lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the<lb/>
head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own<lb/>
mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe<lb/>
that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he<lb/>
has&#x2014;his spout hole&#x2014;is on the top of his head; you observe that<lb/>
his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third<lb/>
of his entire length from the front. Wherefore, you must now<lb/>
have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s head is a<lb/>
dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence<lb/>
of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider<lb/>
that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the<lb/>
front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and<lb/>
not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come<lb/>
to the full cranial development. So that this whole enormous<lb/>
boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be<lb/>
revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet,<lb/>
you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance<lb/>
which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy. In<lb/>
some previous place I have described to you how the blubber<lb/>
wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.<lb/>
Just so with the head; but with this difference: about the<lb/>
head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toug-<lb/>
hness, inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n413" n="376"/>
severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the<lb/>
strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. It is as<lb/>
though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with<lb/>
horses&#x0027; hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.</p>
<p>Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large,<lb/>
loaded Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other<lb/>
in the docks, what do the sailors do? They do not suspend be-<lb/>
tween them, at the point of coming contact, any merely hard<lb/>
substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large,<lb/>
round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and<lb/>
toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the<lb/>
jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes<lb/>
and iron crow-bars. By itself this sufficiently illustrates the<lb/>
obvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to this, it has<lb/>
hypothetically occurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess what<lb/>
is called a swimming bladder in them, capable, at will, of dis-<lb/>
tension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale, as far as I<lb/>
know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the<lb/>
otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his<lb/>
head altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it<lb/>
high elevated out of the water; considering the unobstructed<lb/>
elasticity of its envelop; considering the unique interior of his<lb/>
head; it has hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those<lb/>
mystical lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some<lb/>
hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer<lb/>
air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and con-<lb/>
traction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might,<lb/>
to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements<lb/>
contributes.</p>
<p>Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable,<lb/>
uninjurable wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there<lb/>
swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life, only to be ade-<lb/>
quately estimated as piled wood is&#x2014;by the cord; and all<lb/>
obedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So that when I<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n414" n="377"/>
shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations<lb/>
of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster; when<lb/>
I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining<lb/>
feats; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity,<lb/>
and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale<lb/>
stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the<lb/>
Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of<lb/>
your eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a<lb/>
provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a<lb/>
thing for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the<lb/>
chances for the provincials then? What befel the weakling<lb/>
youth lifting the dread goddess&#x0027;s veil at Lais?</p>

<hi rend="sc">the great heidelburgh tun</hi>.</head>
<p>Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it<lb/>
aright, you must know something of the curious internal struc-<lb/>
ture of the thing operated upon.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s head as a solid oblong, you<lb/>
may, on an inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,<note xml:id="fn17-377"><p>Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical<lb/>
mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a<lb/>
solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the<lb/>
steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both sides.</p></note><lb/>
whereof the lower is the bony structure, forming the cranium<lb/>
and jaws, and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from<lb/>
bones; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical<lb/>
apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the forehead<lb/>
horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n415" n="378"/>
almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an<lb/>
internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.</p>
<p>The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense<lb/>
honeycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and re-crossing, into<lb/>
ten thousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres<lb/>
throughout its whole extent. The upper part, known as the<lb/>
Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the<lb/>
Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is mystically<lb/>
carved in front, so the whale&#x0027;s vast plaited forehead forms innu-<lb/>
merable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his<lb/>
wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always<lb/>
replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish<lb/>
valleys, so the tun of the whale contains by far the most pre-<lb/>
cious of all his oily vintages; namely, the highly-prized sper-<lb/>
maceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and odoriferous state.<lb/>
Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part<lb/>
of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet,<lb/>
upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete;<lb/>
sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin<lb/>
delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale&#x0027;s case<lb/>
generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though<lb/>
from unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled,<lb/>
leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the<lb/>
ticklish business of securing what you can.</p>
<p>I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidel-<lb/>
burgh Tun was coated within, but in superlative richness that<lb/>
coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearl-<lb/>
colored membrane, like the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the<lb/>
inner surface of the Sperm<lb/>
Whale&#x0027;s case.</p>
<p>It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head;<lb/>
and since&#x2014;as has been elsewhere set forth&#x2014;the head embraces<lb/>
one third of the whole length of the creature, then setting that<lb/>
length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n416" n="379"/>
than twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun, when it is length-<lb/>
wise hoisted up and down against a ship&#x0027;s side.</p>
<p>As in decapitating the whale, the operator&#x0027;s instrument is<lb/>
brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently<lb/>
forced into the spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be<lb/>
uncommonly heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke should<lb/>
invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable con-<lb/>
tents. It is this decapitated end of the head, also, which is at<lb/>
last elevated out of the water, and retained in that position by<lb/>
the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on<lb/>
one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.</p>
<p>Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marv-<lb/>
ellous and&#x2014;in this particular instance&#x2014;almost fata, operation<lb/>
whereby the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXXVIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">cistern and buckets</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Nimble</hi> as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering<lb/>
his erect posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging main-<lb/>
yard-arm, to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted<lb/>
Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip,<lb/>
consisting of only two parts, travelling through a single-sheaved<lb/>
block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down from the<lb/>
yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and<lb/>
firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down<lb/>
the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously<lb/>
he lands on the summit of the head. There&#x2014;still high elevated<lb/>
above the rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries&#x2014;-<lb/>
he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to<lb/>
prayers from the top of a tower. A short-handled sharp spade<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n417" n="380"/>
being sent up to him, he diligently searches for the proper place<lb/>
to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business he proceeds<lb/>
very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house, sound-<lb/>
ing the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time<lb/>
this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely<lb/>
like a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip;<lb/>
while the other end, being stretched across the deck, is there<lb/>
held by two or three alert hands. These last now hoist the<lb/>
bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom another person has<lb/>
reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into the<lb/>
bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun,<lb/>
till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to the seamen<lb/>
at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a<lb/>
dairy-maid&#x0027;s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its<lb/>
height, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand,<lb/>
and quickly emptied into a large tub. Then re-mounting aloft,<lb/>
it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern<lb/>
will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has to ram his<lb/>
long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the<lb/>
Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.</p>
<p>Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time<lb/>
in this way; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm;<lb/>
when all at once a queer accident happened. Whether it was<lb/>
that Tashtego, that wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless<lb/>
as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great<lb/>
cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place where<lb/>
he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One<lb/>
himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particu-<lb/>
lar reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but,<lb/>
on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly<lb/>
up&#x2014;my God! poor Tashtego&#x2014;like the twin reciprocating<lb/>
bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this<lb/>
great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling,<lb/>
went clean out of sight!</p>
<pb xml:id="n418" n="381"/>
<p>&#x201C;Man overboard!&#x201D; cried Daggoo, who amid the general con-<lb/>
sternation first came to his senses. &#x201C;Swing the bucket this<lb/>
way!&#x201D; and putting one foot into it, so as the better to secure<lb/>
his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him<lb/>
high up to the top of the head, almost before Tashtego could<lb/>
have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there was a<lb/>
terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before life-<lb/>
less head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the<lb/>
sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea;<lb/>
whereas it was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by<lb/>
those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk.</p>
<p>At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head,<lb/>
was clearing the whip&#x2014;which had somehow got foul of the<lb/>
great cutting tackles&#x2014;a sharp cracking noise was heard; and to<lb/>
the unspeakable horror of all, one of the two enormous hooks sus-<lb/>
pending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration the enor-<lb/>
mous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and shook<lb/>
as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook, upon<lb/>
which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to<lb/>
be on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from<lb/>
the violent motions of the head.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come down, come down!&#x201D; yelled the seamen to Daggoo,<lb/>
but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if<lb/>
the head should drop, he would still remain suspended; the<lb/>
negro having cleared the foul line, rammed down the bucket<lb/>
into the now collapsed well, meaning that the buried harpooneer<lb/>
should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In heaven&#x0027;s name, man,&#x201D; cried Stubb, &#x201C;are you ramming<lb/>
home a cartridge there?&#x2014;Avast! How will that help him;<lb/>
jamming that iron-bound bucket on top of his head? Avast,<lb/>
will ye!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stand clear of the tackle!&#x201D; cried a voice like the bursting<lb/>
of a rocket.</p>
<p>Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enor-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n419" n="382"/>
mous mass dropped into the sea, like Niagara&#x0027;s Table-Rock into<lb/>
the whirlpool; the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it,<lb/>
to far down her glittering copper; and all caught their breath,<lb/>
as half swinging&#x2014;now over the sailors&#x0027; heads, and now over the<lb/>
water&#x2014;Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray, was dimly<lb/>
beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor, buried-<lb/>
alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the<lb/>
sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a<lb/>
naked figure with a boarding-sword in its hand, was for one<lb/>
swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a<lb/>
loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to<lb/>
the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and every<lb/>
eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no<lb/>
sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some<lb/>
hands now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off<lb/>
from the ship.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ha! ha!&#x201D; cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet,<lb/>
swinging perch overhead; and looking further off from the<lb/>
side, we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves; a<lb/>
sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the grass over<lb/>
a grave.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Both! both!&#x2014;it is both!&#x201D;&#x2014;cried Daggoo again with a<lb/>
joyful shout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly strik-<lb/>
ing out with one hand, and with the other clutching the long<lb/>
hair of the Indian. Drawn into the waiting boat, they were<lb/>
quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was long in coming<lb/>
to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.</p>
<p>Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why,<lb/>
diving after the slowly descending head, Queequeg with his<lb/>
keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom, so as to<lb/>
scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had thrust<lb/>
his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out our<lb/>
poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting<lb/>
in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n420" n="383"/>
was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;&#x2014;-<lb/>
he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss,<lb/>
had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the<lb/>
next trial, he came forth in the good old way&#x2014;head foremost.<lb/>
As for the great head itself, that was doing as well as could be<lb/>
expected.</p>
<p>And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics<lb/>
of Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego,<lb/>
was successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most<lb/>
untoward and apparently hopeless impediments; which is a<lb/>
lesson by no means to be forgotten. Midwifery should be<lb/>
taught in the same course with fencing and boxing, riding and<lb/>
rowing.</p>
<p>I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header&#x0027;s will<lb/>
be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen, though they<lb/>
themselves may have either seen or heard of some one&#x0027;s falling<lb/>
into a cistern ashore; an accident which not seldom happens,<lb/>
and with much less reason too than the Indian&#x0027;s, considering<lb/>
the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
well.</p>
<p>But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is<lb/>
this? We thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm<lb/>
Whale, was the lightest and most corky part about him; and<lb/>
yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific<lb/>
gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all, but I<lb/>
have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been<lb/>
nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the<lb/>
dense tendinous wall of the well&#x2014;a double welded, hammered<lb/>
substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea<lb/>
water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But<lb/>
the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the pre-<lb/>
sent instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the<lb/>
head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank very slowly<lb/>
and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance for<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n421" n="384"/>
performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say<lb/>
Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.</p>
<p>Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very<lb/>
precious perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest<lb/>
of fragrant spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the<lb/>
secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale.<lb/>
Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled&#x2014;the delicious<lb/>
death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the<lb/>
crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that<lb/>
leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato&#x0027;s<lb/>
honey head, and sweetly perished there?</p>

<p>To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the<lb/>
head of this Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist<lb/>
or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise<lb/>
would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have scrutinized<lb/>
the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have<lb/>
mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon.<lb/>
Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of the<lb/>
various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of<lb/>
horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the<lb/>
modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall<lb/>
and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touch-<lb/>
ing the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man.<lb/>
Therefore, though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the ap-<lb/>
plication of these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my<lb/>
endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.</p>
<pb xml:id="n422" n="385"/>
<p>Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an<lb/>
anomalous creature. He has no proper nose. And since the<lb/>
nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features; and<lb/>
since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined<lb/>
expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an<lb/>
external appendage, must very largely affect the countenance<lb/>
of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola,<lb/>
monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensa-<lb/>
ble to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiog-<lb/>
nomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of<lb/>
the nose. Dash the nose from Phidias&#x0027;s marble Jove, and what<lb/>
a sorry remainder! Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a<lb/>
magnitude, all his proportions are so stately, that the same de-<lb/>
ficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is<lb/>
no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to<lb/>
the whale would have been impertinent. As on your physiog-<lb/>
nomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat,<lb/>
your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflec-<lb/>
tion that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which<lb/>
so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the<lb/>
mightiest royal beadle on his throne.</p>
<p>In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiog-<lb/>
nomical view to be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full<lb/>
front of his head. This aspect is sublime.</p>
<p>In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when<lb/>
troubled with the morning. In the repose of the pasture, the<lb/>
curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it. Push-<lb/>
ing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the elephant&#x0027;s brow is<lb/>
majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great<lb/>
golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their decrees.<lb/>
It signifies&#x2014;&#x201C;God: done this day by my hand.&#x201D; But in most<lb/>
creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a<lb/>
mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are<lb/>
the foreheads which like Shakspeare&#x0027;s or Melancthon&#x0027;s rise so<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n423" n="386"/>
high, and descend so low, that the eyes themselves seem clear,<lb/>
eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and all above them in the<lb/>
forehead&#x0027;s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered thoughts<lb/>
descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the<lb/>
snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this<lb/>
high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so<lb/>
immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view,<lb/>
you feel the Deity and the dread powers more foreibly than in<lb/>
beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no<lb/>
one point precisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no<lb/>
nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face; he has none, proper; nothing<lb/>
but that one broad firmament of a forehead, pleated with<lb/>
riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships,<lb/>
and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;<lb/>
though that way viewed, its grandeur does not domineer upon<lb/>
you so. In profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-<lb/>
crescentic depression in the forehead&#x0027;s middle, which, in man, is<lb/>
Lavater&#x0027;s mark of genius.</p>
<p>But how? Genius in the Sperm<lb/>
Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book, spoken a speech? No, his great<lb/>
genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it.<lb/>
It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence. And this<lb/>
reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to<lb/>
the young Orient World, he would have been deified by their<lb/>
child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,<lb/>
because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has<lb/>
no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be inca-<lb/>
pable of protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical<lb/>
nation shall lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day<lb/>

<p><hi rend="sc">If</hi> the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the<lb/>
phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is<lb/>
impossible to square.</p>
<p>In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least<lb/>
twenty feet in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side<lb/>
view of this skull is as the side view of a moderately inclined<lb/>
plane resting throughout on a level base. But in life&#x2014;as we<lb/>
have elsewhere seen&#x2014;this inclined plane is angularly filled up,<lb/>
and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of<lb/>
the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater<lb/>
to bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this<lb/>
crater&#x2014;in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length<lb/>
and as many in depth&#x2014;reposes the mere handful of this mon-<lb/>
ster&#x0027;s brain. The brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent<lb/>
forehead in life; it is hidden away behind its vast outworks, like<lb/>
the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of<lb/>
Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in him, that I<lb/>
have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the<lb/>
Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance<lb/>
of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying<lb/>
in strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehen-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n425" n="388"/>
sions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general<lb/>
might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intel-<lb/>
ligence.</p>
<p>It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Levia-<lb/>
than, in the creature&#x0027;s living intact state, is an entire delusion.<lb/>
As for his true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor<lb/>
feel any. The whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a<lb/>
false bow to the common world.</p>
<p>If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a<lb/>
rear view of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be<lb/>
struck by its resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the<lb/>
same situation, and from the same point of view. Indeed, place<lb/>
this reversed skull (scaled down to the human magnitude)<lb/>
among a plate of men&#x0027;s skulls, and you would involuntarily con-<lb/>
found it with them; and remarking the depressions on one<lb/>
part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say&#x2014;<lb/>
This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those<lb/>
negations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his pro-<lb/>
digious bulk and power, you can best form to yourself the<lb/>
truest, though not the most exhilarating conception of what the<lb/>
most exalted potency is.</p>
<p>But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale&#x0027;s proper<lb/>
brain, you deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then<lb/>
I have another idea for you. If you attentively regard almost<lb/>
any quadruped&#x0027;s spine, you will be struck with the resemblance<lb/>
of its vertebr&#x00E6; to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bear-<lb/>
ing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German<lb/>
conceit, that the verteb&#x00E6; are absolutely undeveloped skulls.<lb/>
But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were<lb/>
not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out<lb/>
to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebr&#x00E6;<lb/>
of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked<lb/>
prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have<lb/>
omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n426" n="389"/>
from the cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe<lb/>
that much of a man&#x0027;s character will be found betokened in his<lb/>
backbone. I would rather feel your spine than your skull,<lb/>
whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a<lb/>
full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in the firm auda-<lb/>
cious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world.</p>
<p>Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale.<lb/>
His cranial cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra;<lb/>
and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure<lb/>
ten inches across, being eight in height, and of a triangular<lb/>
figure with the base downwards. As it passes through the<lb/>
remaining vertebr&#x00E6; the canal tapers in size, but for a consider-<lb/>
able distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this<lb/>
canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance&#x2014;<lb/>
the spinal cord&#x2014;as the brain; and directly communicates with<lb/>
the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after emerg-<lb/>
ing from the brain&#x0027;s cavity, the spinal cord remains of an unde-<lb/>
creasing girth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all<lb/>
these circumstances, would it be unreasonable to survey and<lb/>
map out the whale&#x0027;s spine phrenologically? For, viewed in this<lb/>
light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper<lb/>
is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magni-<lb/>
tude of his spinal cord.</p>
<p>But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phreno-<lb/>
logists, I would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment,<lb/>
in reference to the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s hump. This august hump,<lb/>
if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger vertebr&#x00E6;, and is,<lb/>
therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its<lb/>
relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ<lb/>
of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that<lb/>
the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to<lb/>
know.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the pequod meets the virgin</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship<lb/>
Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.</p>
<p>At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the<lb/>
Dutch and Germans are now among the least; but here and<lb/>
there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude, you still<lb/>
occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific.</p>
<p>For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay<lb/>
her respects. While yet some distance from the Pequod, she<lb/>
rounded to, and dropping a boat, her captain was impelled<lb/>
towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the<lb/>
stern.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What has he in his hand there?&#x201D; cried Starbuck, pointing<lb/>
to something wavingly held by the German. &#x201C;Impossible!&#x2014;<lb/>
a lamp-feeder!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not that,&#x201D; said Stubb, &#x201C;no, no, it&#x0027;s a coffee-pot, Mr. Star-<lb/>
buck; he&#x0027;s coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman;<lb/>
don&#x0027;t you see that big tin can there alongside of him?&#x2014;that&#x0027;s<lb/>
his boiling water. Oh! he&#x0027;s all right, is the Yarman.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Go along with you,&#x201D; cried Flask, &#x201C;it&#x0027;s a lamp-feeder and<lb/>
an oil-can. He&#x0027;s out of oil, and has come a-begging.&#x201D;</p>
<p>However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing<lb/>
oil on the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly<lb/>
contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle,<lb/>
yet sometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present<lb/>
case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-<lb/>
feeder as Flask did declare.</p>
<p>As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, with-<lb/>
out at all heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n428" n="391"/>
lingo, the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the<lb/>
White Whale; immediately turning the conversation to his<lb/>
lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching his hav-<lb/>
ing to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness&#x2014;<lb/>
his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-<lb/>
fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by<lb/>
hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is techni-<lb/>
cally called a <hi rend="i">clean</hi> one (that is, an empty one), well deserving<lb/>
the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.</p>
<p>His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not<lb/>
gained his ship&#x0027;s side, when whales were almost simultaneously<lb/>
raised from the mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for<lb/>
the chase was Derick, that without pausing to put his oil-can<lb/>
and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed round his boat and made<lb/>
after the leviathan lamp-feeders.</p>
<p>Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other<lb/>
three German boats that soon followed him, had considerably<lb/>
the start of the Pequod&#x0027;s keels. There were eight whales, an<lb/>
average pod. Aware of their danger, they were going all<lb/>
abreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing<lb/>
their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness.<lb/>
They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling a<lb/>
great wide parchment upon the sea.</p>
<p>Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam<lb/>
a huge, humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow<lb/>
progress, as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations over-<lb/>
growing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice, or some other<lb/>
infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in<lb/>
advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for such<lb/>
venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck<lb/>
to their wake, though indeed their back water must have<lb/>
retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad<lb/>
muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hos-<lb/>
tile currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n429" n="392"/>
coming forth with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself<lb/>
in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean commotions in<lb/>
him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity,<lb/>
causing the waters behind him to upbubble.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who&#x0027;s got some paregoric?&#x201D; said Stubb, &#x201C;he has the<lb/>
stomach-ache, I&#x0027;m afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre<lb/>
of stomach-ache! Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas<lb/>
in him, boys. It&#x0027;s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from<lb/>
astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he&#x0027;s<lb/>
lost his tiller.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan<lb/>
coast with a deck load of frightened horses, careens, buries,<lb/>
rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this old whale heave his<lb/>
aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his cum-<lb/>
brous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the<lb/>
unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost<lb/>
that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to<lb/>
say.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Only wait a bit, old chap, and I&#x0027;ll give ye a sling for that<lb/>
wounded arm,&#x201D; cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line<lb/>
near him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mind he don&#x0027;t sling thee with it,&#x201D; cried Starbuck. &#x201C;Give<lb/>
way, or the German will have him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed<lb/>
for this one fish, because not only was he the largest, and there-<lb/>
fore the most valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and<lb/>
the other whales were going with such great velocity, moreover,<lb/>
as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At this juncture, the<lb/>
Pequod&#x0027;s keels had shot by the three German boats last low-<lb/>
ered; but from the great start he had had, Derick&#x0027;s boat still<lb/>
led the chase, though every moment neared by his foreign<lb/>
rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being<lb/>
already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his<lb/>
iron before they could completely overtake and pass him. As<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n430" n="393"/>
for Derick, he seemed quite confident that this would be the<lb/>
case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-<lb/>
feeder at the other boats.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The ungracious and ungrateful dog!&#x201D; cried Starbuck; &#x201C;he<lb/>
mocks and dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not<lb/>
five minutes ago!&#x201D;&#x2014;then in his old intense whisper&#x2014;&#x201C;give<lb/>
way, greyhounds! Dog to it!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I tell ye what it is, men&#x201D;&#x2014;cried Stubb to his crew&#x2014;&#x201D; It&#x0027;s<lb/>
against my religion to get mad; but I&#x0027;d like to eat that villa-<lb/>
nous Yarman&#x2014;Pull&#x2014;wont ye? Are ye going to let that rascal<lb/>
beat ye? Do ye love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then,<lb/>
to the best man. Come, why don&#x0027;t some of ye burst a blood-<lb/>
vessel? Who&#x0027;s that been dropping an anchor overboard&#x2014;we<lb/>
don&#x0027;t budge an inch&#x2014;we&#x0027;re becalmed. Halloo, here&#x0027;s grass<lb/>
growing in the boat&#x0027;s bottom&#x2014;and by the Lord, the mast<lb/>
there&#x0027;s budding. This won&#x0027;t do, boys. Look at that Yarman!<lb/>
The short and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! see the suds he makes!&#x201D; cried Flask, dancing up and<lb/>
down&#x2014;&#x201D; What a hump&#x2014;Oh, <hi rend="i">do</hi> pile on the beef&#x2014;lays like a<lb/>
log! Oh! my lads, <hi rend="i">do</hi> spring&#x2014;slap-jacks and quohogs for sup-<lb/>
per, you know, my lads&#x2014;baked clams and muffins&#x2014;oh, <hi rend="i">do, do</hi>,<lb/>
spring&#x2014;he&#x0027;s a hundred barreler&#x2014;don&#x0027;t lose him now&#x2014;don&#x0027;t,<lb/>
oh, <hi rend="i">don&#x0027;t!</hi>&#x2014;see that Yarman&#x2014;Oh! won&#x0027;t ye pull for your duff,<lb/>
my lads&#x2014;such a sog! such a sogger! Don&#x0027;t ye love sperm?<lb/>
There goes three thousand dollars, men!&#x2014;a bank!&#x2014;a whole<lb/>
bank! The bank of England!&#x2014;Oh, <hi rend="i">do, do, do!</hi>&#x2014;What&#x0027;s that<lb/>
Yarman about now?&#x201D;</p>
<p>At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-<lb/>
feeder at the advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with<lb/>
the double view of retarding his rivals&#x0027; way, and at the same time<lb/>
economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus<lb/>
of the backward toss.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The unmannerly Dutch dogger!&#x201D; cried Stubb. &#x201C;Pull now,<lb/>
men, like fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n431" n="394"/>
devils. What d&#x0027;ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap<lb/>
your spine in two-and-twenty pieces for the honor of old Gay-<lb/>
head? What d&#x0027;ye say?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I say, pull like god-dam,&#x201D;&#x2014;cried the Indian.</p>
<p>Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the<lb/>
Pequod&#x0027;s three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so<lb/>
disposed, momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chival-<lb/>
rous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey,<lb/>
the three mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after<lb/>
oarsman with an exhilarating cry of, &#x201C;There she slides, now!<lb/>
Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman!<lb/>
Sail over him!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite<lb/>
of all their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this<lb/>
race, had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a<lb/>
crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman. While<lb/>
this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and while,<lb/>
in consequence, Derick&#x0027;s boat was nigh to capsizing, and he<lb/>
thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;&#x2014;that was a<lb/>
good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they<lb/>
took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the<lb/>
German&#x0027;s quarter. An instant more, and all four boats were<lb/>
diagonically in the whale&#x0027;s immediate wake, while stretching<lb/>
from them, on both sides, was the foaming swell that he made.</p>
<p>It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The<lb/>
whale was now going head out, and sending his spout before<lb/>
him in a continual tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat<lb/>
his side in an agony of fright. Now to this hand, now to that,<lb/>
he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he<lb/>
broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways rolled<lb/>
towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with<lb/>
clipped wing, making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly<lb/>
striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a<lb/>
voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n432" n="395"/>
the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and<lb/>
enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking respira-<lb/>
tion through his spiracle, and this made the sight of him<lb/>
unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcul-<lb/>
lis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the<lb/>
stoutest man who so pitied.</p>
<p>Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give<lb/>
the Pequod&#x0027;s boats the advantage, and rather than be thus<lb/>
foiled of his game, Derick chose to hazard what to him must<lb/>
have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last chance<lb/>
would for ever escape.</p>
<p>But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke,<lb/>
than all three tigers&#x2014;Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo&#x2014;instinc-<lb/>
tively sprang to their feet, and standing in a diagonal row,<lb/>
simultaneously pointed their barbs; and darted over the head of<lb/>
the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket irons entered the<lb/>
whale. Blinding vapors of foam and white-fire! The three<lb/>
boats, in the first fury of the whale&#x0027;s headlong rush, bumped the<lb/>
German&#x0027;s aside with such force, that both Derick and his<lb/>
baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three<lb/>
flying keels.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t be afraid, my butter-boxes,&#x201D; cried Stubb, casting a<lb/>
passing glance upon them as he shot by; &#x201C;ye&#x0027;ll be picked up<lb/>
presently&#x2014;all right&#x2014;I saw some sharks astern&#x2014;St. Bernard&#x0027;s<lb/>
dogs, you know&#x2014;relieve distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is<lb/>
the way to sail now. Every keel a sun-beam! Hurrah!&#x2014;<lb/>
Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar!<lb/>
This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury<lb/>
on a plain&#x2014;makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten<lb/>
to him that way; and there&#x0027;s danger of being pitched out too,<lb/>
when you strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels<lb/>
when he&#x0027;s going to Davy Jones&#x2014;all a rush down an endless<lb/>
inclined plane! Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting<lb/>
mail!&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n433" n="396"/>
<p>But the monster&#x0027;s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden<lb/>
gasp, he tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the<lb/>
three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to<lb/>
gouge deep grooves in them; while so fearful were the harpoon-<lb/>
eers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines, that<lb/>
using all their dexterous might, they caught repeated smoking<lb/>
turns with the rope to hold on; till at last&#x2014;owing to the per-<lb/>
pendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of the boats, whence<lb/>
the three ropes went straight down into the blue&#x2014;the gunwales<lb/>
of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three<lb/>
sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to<lb/>
sound, for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of<lb/>
expending more line, though the position was a little ticklish.<lb/>
But though boats have been taken down and lost in this way,<lb/>
yet it is this &#x201C;holding on,&#x201D; as it is called; this hooking up by<lb/>
the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that<lb/>
often torments the Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the<lb/>
sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril of the<lb/>
thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best;<lb/>
for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken<lb/>
whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,<lb/>
owing to the enormous surface of him&#x2014;in a full grown sperm<lb/>
whale something less than 2000 square feet&#x2014;the pressure of the<lb/>
water is immense. We all know what an astonishing atmo-<lb/>
spheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here, above-<lb/>
ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bear-<lb/>
ing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean!<lb/>
It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One<lb/>
whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle<lb/>
ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on board.</p>
<p>As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing<lb/>
down into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or<lb/>
cry of any sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came<lb/>
up from its depths; what landsman would have thought, that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n434" n="397"/>
beneath all that silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the<lb/>
seas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight inches<lb/>
of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows. Seems it credi-<lb/>
ble that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was<lb/>
suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Sus-<lb/>
pended? and to what? To three bits of board. Is this the<lb/>
creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said&#x2014;&#x201D; Canst<lb/>
thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-<lb/>
spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold,<lb/>
the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as<lb/>
straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as<lb/>
stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!&#x201D; This the<lb/>
creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should follow the<lb/>
prophets. For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his<lb/>
tail, Leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the<lb/>
sea, to hide him from the Pequod&#x0027;s fish-spears!</p>
<p>In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three<lb/>
boats sent down beneath the surface, must have been long<lb/>
enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes&#x0027; army. Who<lb/>
can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been<lb/>
such huge phantoms flitting over his head!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stand by, men; he stirs,&#x201D; cried Starbuck, as the three lines<lb/>
suddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards<lb/>
to them, as by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the<lb/>
whale, so that every oarsman felt them in his seat. The next<lb/>
moment, relieved in great part from the downward strain at the<lb/>
bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small ice-<lb/>
field will, when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it<lb/>
into the sea.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Haul in! Haul in!&#x201D; cried Starbuck again; &#x201C;he&#x0027;s rising.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand&#x0027;s<lb/>
breadth could have been gained, were now in long quick coils<lb/>
flung back all dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke<lb/>
water within two ship&#x0027;s lengths of the hunters.</p>
<pb xml:id="n435" n="398"/>
<p>His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In<lb/>
most land animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many<lb/>
of their veins, whereby when wounded, the blood is in some<lb/>
degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions. Not so<lb/>
with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is, to have an<lb/>
entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that when<lb/>
pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is<lb/>
at once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is<lb/>
heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great<lb/>
distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him<lb/>
in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in<lb/>
him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that he<lb/>
will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period;<lb/>
even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-<lb/>
springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when<lb/>
the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his<lb/>
swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were<lb/>
followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept<lb/>
continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was<lb/>
only at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture<lb/>
into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because<lb/>
no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they<lb/>
significantly call it, was untouched.</p>
<p>As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole<lb/>
upper part of his form, with much of it that is ordinarily sub-<lb/>
merged, was plainly revealed. His eyes, or rather the places<lb/>
where his eyes had been, were beheld. As strange misgrown<lb/>
masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when pros-<lb/>
trate, so from the points which the whale&#x0027;s eyes had once<lb/>
occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.<lb/>
But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm,<lb/>
and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in<lb/>
order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men,<lb/>
and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach uncon-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n436" n="399"/>
ditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his blood,<lb/>
at last he partially disclosed a strangely discolored bunch or<lb/>
protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A nice spot,&#x201D; cried Flask; &#x201C;just let me prick him there<lb/>
once.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Avast!&#x201D; cried Starbuck, &#x201C;there&#x0027;s no need of that!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the<lb/>
dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by<lb/>
it into more than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting<lb/>
thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespat-<lb/>
tering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of<lb/>
gore, capsizing Flask&#x0027;s boat and marring the bows. It was his<lb/>
death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by loss of<lb/>
blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had<lb/>
made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his<lb/>
stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a waning<lb/>
world; turned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log,<lb/>
and died. It was most piteous, that last expiring spout. As<lb/>
when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from<lb/>
some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy gur-<lb/>
glings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground&#x2014;so<lb/>
the last long dying spout of the whale.</p>
<p>Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship,<lb/>
the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures<lb/>
unrifled. Immediately, by Starbuck&#x0027;s orders, lines were secured<lb/>
to it at different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy;<lb/>
the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them<lb/>
by the cords. By very heedful management, when the ship<lb/>
drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was<lb/>
strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was<lb/>
plain that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once<lb/>
sink to the bottom.</p>
<p>It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with<lb/>
the spade, the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n437" n="400"/>
imbedded in his flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before de-<lb/>
scribed. But as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found<lb/>
in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh perfectly<lb/>
healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote<lb/>
their place; therefore, there must needs have been some other<lb/>
unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the<lb/>
ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a<lb/>
lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried<lb/>
iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that<lb/>
stone lance? And when? It might have been darted by some<lb/>
Nor&#x0027; West Indian long before America was discovered.</p>
<p>What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this<lb/>
monstrous cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was<lb/>
put to further discoveries, by the ship&#x0027;s being unprecedentedly<lb/>
dragged over sideways to the sea, owing to the body&#x0027;s im-<lb/>
mensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck, who<lb/>
had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on<lb/>
to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship would<lb/>
have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the<lb/>
body; then, when the command was given to break clear from<lb/>
it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to<lb/>
which the fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was im-<lb/>
possible to cast them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod<lb/>
was aslant. To cross to the other side of the deck was like<lb/>
walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned<lb/>
and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and<lb/>
cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural disloca-<lb/>
tion. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon<lb/>
the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timber-<lb/>
heads; and so low had the whale now settled that the sub-<lb/>
merged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment<lb/>
whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk,<lb/>
and the ship seemed on the point of going over.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hold on, hold on, won&#x0027;t ye?&#x201D; cried Stubb to the body,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n438" n="401"/>
&#x201C;don&#x0027;t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder,<lb/>
men, we must do something or go for it. No use prying<lb/>
there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of ye<lb/>
for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Knife? Aye, aye,&#x201D; cried Queequeg, and seizing the<lb/>
carpenter&#x0027;s heavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and<lb/>
steel to iron, began slashing at the largest fluke-chains. But a<lb/>
few strokes, full of sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain<lb/>
effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every fastening went<lb/>
adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.</p>
<p>Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed<lb/>
Sperm Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman<lb/>
yet adequately accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm<lb/>
Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly con-<lb/>
siderably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that<lb/>
thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their<lb/>
pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic;<lb/>
then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is<lb/>
caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking,<lb/>
consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But<lb/>
it is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and<lb/>
swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm<lb/>
flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them;<lb/>
even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.</p>
<p>Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable<lb/>
to this accident than any other species. Where one of that<lb/>
sort go down, twenty Right Whales do. This difference in the<lb/>
species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater<lb/>
quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds<lb/>
alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this in-<lb/>
cumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are<lb/>
instances where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the<lb/>
sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the<lb/>
reason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n439" n="402"/>
swells to a prodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal<lb/>
balloon. A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under<lb/>
then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays<lb/>
of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking,<lb/>
they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when<lb/>
the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when<lb/>
it shall have ascended again.</p>
<p>It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was<lb/>
heard from the Pequod&#x0027;s mast-heads, announcing that the<lb/>
Jungfrau was again lowering her boats; though the only spout<lb/>
in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species of<lb/>
uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swim-<lb/>
ming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back&#x0027;s spout is so similar to the<lb/>
Sperm Whale&#x0027;s, that by unskilful tishermen it is often mistaken<lb/>
for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now in<lb/>
valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding<lb/>
all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all dis-<lb/>
appeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.</p>
<p>Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my<lb/>
friend.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">There</hi> are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness<lb/>
is the true method.</p>
<p>The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my<lb/>
researches up to the very spring-head of it, so much the more<lb/>
am I impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity; and<lb/>
especially when I find so many great demi-gods and heroes,<lb/>
prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have shed distinc-<lb/>
tion upon it, I am transported with the reflection that I myself<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n440" n="403"/>
belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a fra-<lb/>
ternity.</p>
<p>The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman;<lb/>
and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first<lb/>
whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any<lb/>
sordid intent. Those were the knightly days of our profession,<lb/>
when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to fill<lb/>
men&#x0027;s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine story of Perseus<lb/>
and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of<lb/>
a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan<lb/>
was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of<lb/>
whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and<lb/>
delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic<lb/>
exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present<lb/>
day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first<lb/>
dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the<lb/>
ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the<lb/>
Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of<lb/>
a whale, which the city&#x0027;s legends and all the inhabitants assert-<lb/>
ed to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.<lb/>
When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried<lb/>
to Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggest-<lb/>
ively important in this story, is this: it was from Joppa that<lb/>
Jonah set sail.</p>
<p>Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda&#x2014;indeed,<lb/>
by some supposed to be indirectly derived from it&#x2014;is that<lb/>
famous story of St. George and the Dragon; which dragon I<lb/>
maintain to have been a whale; for in many old chronicles<lb/>
whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and often<lb/>
stand for each other. &#x201C;Thou art as a lion of the waters, and<lb/>
as a dragon of the sea,&#x201D; saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning<lb/>
a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word<lb/>
itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the<lb/>
exploit had St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n441" n="404"/>
the land, instead of doing battle with the great monster of the<lb/>
deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a Perseus, a St.<lb/>
George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to<lb/>
a whale.</p>
<p>Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for<lb/>
though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of<lb/>
old is vaguely represented of a griffin-like shape, and though<lb/>
the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback, yet<lb/>
considering the great ignorance of those times, when the true<lb/>
form of the whale was unknown to artists; and considering<lb/>
that as in Perseus&#x0027; case, St. George&#x0027;s whale might have crawled<lb/>
up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the ani-<lb/>
mal ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or<lb/>
sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether<lb/>
incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts<lb/>
of the scene, to hold this so-called dragon no other than the<lb/>
great Leviathan himself. In fact, placed before the strict and<lb/>
piercing truth, this whole story will fare like that fish, flesh, and<lb/>
fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who being<lb/>
planted before the ark of Israel, his horse&#x0027;s head and both the<lb/>
palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the stump or<lb/>
fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble<lb/>
stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England;<lb/>
and by good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be<lb/>
enrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And there-<lb/>
fore, let not the knights of that honorable company (none of<lb/>
whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do with a whale like<lb/>
their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer with dis-<lb/>
dain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are<lb/>
much better entitled to St. George&#x0027;s decoration than they.</p>
<p>Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I<lb/>
long remained dubious: for though according to the Greek my-<lb/>
thologies, that antique Crockett and Kit Carson&#x2014;that brawny<lb/>
doer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed down and thrown<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n442" n="405"/>
up by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman<lb/>
of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he<lb/>
ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.<lb/>
Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whale-<lb/>
man; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the<lb/>
whale. I claim him for one of our clan.</p>
<p>But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story<lb/>
of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the<lb/>
still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and<lb/>
vice vers&#x00E2;; certainly they are very similar. If I claim the<lb/>
demi-god then, why not the prophet?</p>
<p>Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise<lb/>
the whole roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be<lb/>
named; for like royal kings of old times, we find the head-<lb/>
waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods<lb/>
themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to be<lb/>
rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo,<lb/>
one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives<lb/>
us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;&#x2014;Vishnoo, who,<lb/>
by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has forever set apart<lb/>
and sanctified the whale. When Bramha, or the God of Gods,<lb/>
saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate the world after one of its<lb/>
periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to preside<lb/>
over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books, whose perusal<lb/>
would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before be-<lb/>
ginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained<lb/>
something in the shape of practical hints to young architects,<lb/>
these Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vish-<lb/>
noo became incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him<lb/>
to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred volumes. Was not<lb/>
this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a<lb/>
horse is called a horseman?</p>
<p>Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there&#x0027;s<lb/>
a member-roll for you! What club but the whaleman&#x0027;s can<lb/>
head off like that?</p>

<head>CHAPTER LXXXIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">jonah historically regarded</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Reference</hi> was made to the historical story of Jonah and<lb/>
the whale in the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers<lb/>
rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale.<lb/>
But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who,<lb/>
standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally<lb/>
doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the<lb/>
dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make<lb/>
those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.</p>
<p>One old Sag-Harbor whaleman&#x0027;s chief reason for questioning<lb/>
the Hebrew story was this:&#x2014;He had one of those quaint old-<lb/>
fashioned Bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates;<lb/>
one of which represented Jonah&#x0027;s whale with two spouts in his<lb/>
head&#x2014;a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the<lb/>
Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order),<lb/>
concerning which the fishermen have this saying, &#x201C;A penny roll<lb/>
would choke him;&#x201D; his swallow is so very small. But, to this,<lb/>
Bishop Jebb&#x0027;s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,<lb/>
hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his<lb/>
mouth. And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop.<lb/>
For truly, the Right Whale&#x0027;s mouth would accommodate a<lb/>
couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players.<lb/>
Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow<lb/>
tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.</p>
<p>Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name)<lb/>
urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was<lb/>
something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n444" n="407"/>
the whale&#x0027;s gastric juices. But this objection likewise falls to<lb/>
the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must<lb/>
have taken refuge in the floating body of a <hi rend="i">dead</hi> whale&#x2014;even<lb/>
as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their<lb/>
dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has<lb/>
been divined by other continental commentators, that when<lb/>
Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straight-<lb/>
way effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel<lb/>
with a whale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly<lb/>
called &#x201C;The Whale,&#x201D; as some craft are nowadays christened the<lb/>
&#x201C;Shark,&#x201D; the &#x201C;Gull,&#x201D; the &#x201C;Eagle.&#x201D; Nor have there been<lb/>
wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale men-<lb/>
tioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver&#x2014;an<lb/>
inflated bag of wind&#x2014;which the endangered prophet swam to,<lb/>
and so was saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor,<lb/>
therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another<lb/>
reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right:<lb/>
Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea,<lb/>
and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three<lb/>
days&#x0027; journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more<lb/>
than three days&#x0027; journey across from the nearest point of the<lb/>
Mediterranean coast. How is that?</p>
<p>But was there no other way for the whale to land the pro-<lb/>
phet within that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might<lb/>
have carried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.<lb/>
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the<lb/>
Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and<lb/>
Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete circum-<lb/>
navigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris<lb/>
waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any<lb/>
whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah&#x0027;s weathering the<lb/>
Cape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of<lb/>
the discovery of that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz,<lb/>
its reputed discoverer, and so make modern history a liar.</p>
<pb xml:id="n445" n="408"/>
<p>But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only<lb/>
evinced his foolish pride of reason&#x2014;a thing still more reprehen-<lb/>
sible in him, seeing that he had but little learning except what<lb/>
he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it only<lb/>
shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebel-<lb/>
lion against the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic<lb/>
priest, this very idea of Jonah&#x0027;s going to Nineveh vi&#x00E2; the<lb/>
Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of<lb/>
the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the<lb/>
highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story<lb/>
of Jonah. And some three centuries ago, an English traveller<lb/>
in old Harris&#x0027;s Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in<lb/>
honor of Jonah, in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that<lb/>
burnt without any oil.</p>

<hi rend="sc">pitchpoling</hi>.</head>
<p>To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages<lb/>
are anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers<lb/>
perform an analogous operation upon their boat; they grease<lb/>
the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure<lb/>
can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advan-<lb/>
tage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a<lb/>
sliding thing, and that the object in view is to make the boat<lb/>
slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his<lb/>
boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jung-<lb/>
frau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occu-<lb/>
pation; crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side,<lb/>
and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to<lb/>
insure a crop of hair from the craft&#x0027;s bald keel. He seemed to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n446" n="409"/>
be working in obedience to some particular presentiment.<lb/>
Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.</p>
<p>Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship<lb/>
sailed down to them, they turned and fled with swift precipi-<lb/>
tancy; a disordered flight, as of Cleopatra&#x0027;s barges from Actium.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb&#x0027;s was foremost.<lb/>
By great exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one<lb/>
iron; but the stricken whale, without at all sounding, still con-<lb/>
tinued his horizontal flight, with added fleetness. Such unin-<lb/>
termitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later<lb/>
inevitably extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying<lb/>
whale, or be content to lose him. But to haul the boat up to<lb/>
his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and furious. What<lb/>
then remained?</p>
<p>Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of<lb/>
hand and countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman<lb/>
is so often forced, none exceed that fine man&#x0153;uvre with the<lb/>
lance called pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword, in all<lb/>
its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable with<lb/>
an inveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the<lb/>
wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted<lb/>
from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme headway.<lb/>
Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve<lb/>
feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the har-<lb/>
poon, and also of a lighter material&#x2014;pine. It is furnished with<lb/>
a small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it<lb/>
can be hauled back to the hand after darting.</p>
<p>But before going further, it is important to mention here,<lb/>
that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way<lb/>
with the lance, yet it is seldom done; and when done, is still<lb/>
less frequently successful, on account of the greater weight and<lb/>
inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance,<lb/>
which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n447" n="410"/>
therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any pitch-<lb/>
poling comes into play.</p>
<p>Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, de-<lb/>
liberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies, was<lb/>
specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling. Look at him; he<lb/>
stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat; wrapt in fleecy<lb/>
foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead. Handling the long<lb/>
lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if<lb/>
it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of<lb/>
the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp,<lb/>
leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full<lb/>
before his waistband&#x0027;s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,<lb/>
covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his<lb/>
hand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly<lb/>
balanced upon his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you<lb/>
somewhat of a juggler, balancing a long staff on his chin.<lb/>
Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse, in a superb lofty<lb/>
arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers in<lb/>
the life spot of the whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now<lb/>
spouts red blood.</p>
<p>&#x201C;That drove the spigot out of him!&#x201D; cries Stubb. &#x201C;&#x0027;Tis<lb/>
July&#x0027;s immortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine to-day!<lb/>
Would now, it were old Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or un-<lb/>
speakable old Monongahela! Then, Tashtego, lad, I&#x0027;d have ye<lb/>
hold a canakin to the jet, and we&#x0027;d drink round it! Yea,<lb/>
verily, hearts alive, we&#x0027;d brew choice punch in the spread of<lb/>
his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the<lb/>
living stuff!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart<lb/>
is repeated, the spear returning to its master like a greyhound<lb/>
held in skilful leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry;<lb/>
the tow-line is slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern,<lb/>
folds his hands, and mutely watches the monster die.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the fountain</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">That</hi> for six thousand years&#x2014;and no one knows how many<lb/>
millions of ages before&#x2014;the great whales should have been<lb/>
spouting all over the sea, and sprinkling and mistifying the<lb/>
gardens of the deep, as with so many sprinkling or mistifying<lb/>
pots; and that for some centuries back, thousands of hunters<lb/>
should have been close by the fountain of the whale, watching<lb/>
these sprinklings and spoutings&#x2014;that all this should be, and<lb/>
yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter<lb/>
minutes past one o&#x0027;clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December,<lb/>
A.D. 1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these<lb/>
spoutings are, after all, really water, or nothing but vapor&#x2014;this<lb/>
is surely a noteworthy thing.</p>
<p>Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting<lb/>
items contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cun-<lb/>
ning of their gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air<lb/>
which at all times is combined with the element in which they<lb/>
swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and<lb/>
never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to his<lb/>
marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a<lb/>
human being&#x0027;s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disen-<lb/>
gaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for<lb/>
his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any<lb/>
degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,<lb/>
the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath<lb/>
the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no con-<lb/>
nexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle<lb/>
alone; and this is on the top of his head.</p>
<pb xml:id="n449" n="412"/>
<p>If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function<lb/>
indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air<lb/>
a certain element, which being subsequently brought into con-<lb/>
tact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle,<lb/>
I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some<lb/>
superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if<lb/>
all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath, he<lb/>
might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a con-<lb/>
siderable time. That is to say, he would then live without<lb/>
breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the<lb/>
case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his<lb/>
full hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a<lb/>
single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of<lb/>
air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between<lb/>
his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a<lb/>
remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels,<lb/>
which vessels, when he quits the surface, are completely dis-<lb/>
tended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more, a<lb/>
thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vita-<lb/>
lity in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries<lb/>
a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplemen-<lb/>
tary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indis-<lb/>
putable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable<lb/>
and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the<lb/>
otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in <hi rend="i">having his<lb/>
spoutings out</hi>, as the fishermon phrase it. This is what I mean.<lb/>
If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will<lb/>
continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his<lb/>
other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and<lb/>
jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then when-<lb/>
ever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths<lb/>
over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths<lb/>
you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging<lb/>
up again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n450" n="413"/>
till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to<lb/>
stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that in differ-<lb/>
ent individuals these rates are different; but in any one they are<lb/>
alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his<lb/>
spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere<lb/>
descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this neces-<lb/>
sity for the whale&#x0027;s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards<lb/>
of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast levia-<lb/>
than be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the<lb/>
sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great<lb/>
necessities that strike the victory to thee!</p>
<p>In man, breathing is incessantly going on&#x2014;one breath only<lb/>
serving for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other busi-<lb/>
ness he has to attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must,<lb/>
or die he will. But the Sperm Whale only breathes about one<lb/>
seventh or Sunday of his time.</p>
<p>It has been said that the whale only breathes through his<lb/>
spout-hole; if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are<lb/>
mixed with water, then I opine we should be furnished with<lb/>
the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him; for<lb/>
the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that<lb/>
identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two elements,<lb/>
it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But<lb/>
owing to the mystery of the spout&#x2014;whether it be water or<lb/>
whether it be vapor&#x2014;no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived<lb/>
at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale<lb/>
has no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them?<lb/>
No roses, no violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his<lb/>
spouting canal, and as that long canal&#x2014;like the grand Erie Canal<lb/>
&#x2014;is furnished with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the<lb/>
downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water,<lb/>
therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by saying,<lb/>
that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n451" n="414"/>
then again, what has the whale to say? Seldom have I known<lb/>
any profound being that had anything to say to this world,<lb/>
unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a<lb/>
living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent<lb/>
listener!</p>
<p>Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly in-<lb/>
tended as it is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet<lb/>
laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his<lb/>
head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much<lb/>
like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But<lb/>
the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe;<lb/>
in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the<lb/>
mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled<lb/>
breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and dis-<lb/>
charged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth<lb/>
indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot<lb/>
be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water<lb/>
through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so<lb/>
doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes<lb/>
in water. But the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s food is far beneath the sur-<lb/>
face, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if<lb/>
you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch,<lb/>
you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating<lb/>
rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods<lb/>
of respiration.</p>
<p>But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject?<lb/>
Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the<lb/>
spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this<lb/>
world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I have ever<lb/>
found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this<lb/>
whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided<lb/>
as to what it is precisely.</p>
<p>The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist<lb/>
enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n452" n="415"/>
falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a<lb/>
whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious<lb/>
commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at<lb/>
such times you should think that you really perceived drops of<lb/>
moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not<lb/>
merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that<lb/>
they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the<lb/>
spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s head? For even when tranquilly swimming through<lb/>
the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as<lb/>
a dromedary&#x0027;s in the desert; even then, the whale always car-<lb/>
ries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun<lb/>
you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.</p>
<p>Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious<lb/>
touching the precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do<lb/>
for him to be peering into it, and putting his face in it. You<lb/>
cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and<lb/>
bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact with<lb/>
the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen,<lb/>
your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing<lb/>
so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer<lb/>
contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in<lb/>
view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his<lb/>
cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is<lb/>
deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another thing; I<lb/>
have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet<lb/>
is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest<lb/>
thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this<lb/>
deadly spout alone.</p>
<p>Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and<lb/>
establish. My hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but<lb/>
mist. And besides other reasons, to this conclusion I am im-<lb/>
pelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and<lb/>
sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n453" n="416"/>
shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is<lb/>
never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales some-<lb/>
times are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am<lb/>
convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings,<lb/>
such as Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on,<lb/>
there always goes up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the<lb/>
act of thinking deep thoughts. While composing a little<lb/>
treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror before<lb/>
me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved<lb/>
worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head. The<lb/>
invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought,<lb/>
after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August<lb/>
noon; this seems an additional argument for the above supposi-<lb/>
tion.</p>
<p>And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty<lb/>
monster, to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical<lb/>
sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor, en-<lb/>
gendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that<lb/>
vapor&#x2014;as you will sometimes see it&#x2014;glorified by a rainbow, as<lb/>
if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts. For, d&#x0027;ye<lb/>
see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate<lb/>
vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts<lb/>
in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling<lb/>
my fog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for<lb/>
all have doubts; many deny; but doubts or denials, few along<lb/>
with them, have intuitions. Doubts of all things earthly, and<lb/>
intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes<lb/>
neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them<lb/>
both with equal eye.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the tail</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Other</hi> poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the<lb/>
antelope, and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights;<lb/>
less celestial, I celebrate a tail.</p>
<p>Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale&#x0027;s tail to begin<lb/>
at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of<lb/>
a man, it comprises upon its upper surface alone, an area of at<lb/>
least fifty square feet. The compact round body of its root<lb/>
expands into two broad, firm, flat palms or flukes, gradually<lb/>
shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness. At the crotch<lb/>
or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways recede<lb/>
from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between.<lb/>
In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely<lb/>
defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its<lb/>
utmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will con-<lb/>
siderably exceed twenty feet across.</p>
<p>The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded<lb/>
sinews; but cut into it, and you find that three distinct strata com-<lb/>
pose it:&#x2014;upper, middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and<lb/>
lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the middle one,<lb/>
very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers.<lb/>
This triune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to<lb/>
the tail. To the student of old Roman walls, the middle layer<lb/>
will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always<lb/>
alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the<lb/>
antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great<lb/>
strength of the masonry.</p>
<p>But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n455" n="418"/>
enough, the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a<lb/>
warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments, which passing<lb/>
on either side the loins and running down into the flukes, insen-<lb/>
sibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their might;<lb/>
so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole<lb/>
whale seems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation<lb/>
occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.</p>
<p>Nor does this&#x2014;its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple<lb/>
the graceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease<lb/>
undulates through a Titanism of power. On the contrary,<lb/>
those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it. Real<lb/>
strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows<lb/>
it; and in everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much<lb/>
to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that all over<lb/>
seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its<lb/>
charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen<lb/>
sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed<lb/>
with the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman<lb/>
triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God the Father<lb/>
in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever<lb/>
they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,<lb/>
hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been<lb/>
most successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they<lb/>
are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere<lb/>
negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on<lb/>
all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his<lb/>
teachings.</p>
<p>Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that<lb/>
whether wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever<lb/>
be the mood it be in, its flexions are invariably marked by ex-<lb/>
ceeding grace. Therein no fairy&#x0027;s arm can transcend it.</p>
<p>Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as<lb/>
a fin for progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n456" n="419"/>
Third, in sweeping; Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking<lb/>
flukes.</p>
<p>First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan&#x0027;s tail<lb/>
acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea crea-<lb/>
tures. It never wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign<lb/>
of inferiority. To the whale, his tail is the sole means of pro-<lb/>
pulsion. Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and then<lb/>
rapidly sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular<lb/>
darting, leaping motion to the monster when furiously swim-<lb/>
ming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.</p>
<p>Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale<lb/>
only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw,<lb/>
nevertheless, in his conflicts with man, he chiefly and contempt<lb/>
ously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he swiftly curves<lb/>
away his flukes from it, and the blow is only inflicted by the<lb/>
recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it<lb/>
descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No<lb/>
ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only salvation lies<lb/>
in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the opposing<lb/>
water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale-<lb/>
boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed<lb/>
plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most<lb/>
serious result. These submerged side blows are so often<lb/>
received in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child&#x0027;s<lb/>
play. Some one strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.</p>
<p>Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in<lb/>
the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for<lb/>
in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the<lb/>
daintiness of the elephant&#x0027;s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly<lb/>
evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness<lb/>
the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes<lb/>
from side to side upon the surface of the sea; and if he feel<lb/>
but a sailor&#x0027;s whisker, woe to that sailor, whiskers and all.<lb/>
What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch! Had this<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n457" n="420"/>
tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me<lb/>
of Darmonodes&#x0027; elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and<lb/>
with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then<lb/>
caressed their zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is<lb/>
that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his<lb/>
tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that when<lb/>
wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the<lb/>
dart.</p>
<p>Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied<lb/>
security of the middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent<lb/>
from the vast corpulence of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays<lb/>
on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you see his power<lb/>
in his play. The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into<lb/>
the air; then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion<lb/>
resounds for miles. You would almost think a great gun had<lb/>
been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor<lb/>
from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that<lb/>
that was the smoke from the touch-hole.</p>
<p>Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan<lb/>
the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they are<lb/>
then completely out of sight beneath the surface; but when he<lb/>
is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire flukes with at<lb/>
least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air, and so<lb/>
remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of<lb/>
view. Excepting the sublime <hi rend="i">breach</hi>&#x2014;somewhere else to be<lb/>
described&#x2014;this peaking of the whale&#x0027;s flukes is perhaps the<lb/>
grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of<lb/>
the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically<lb/>
snatching at the highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen<lb/>
majestic Satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from<lb/>
the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all<lb/>
in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the devils will<lb/>
occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at<lb/>
the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n458" n="421"/>
sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east, all<lb/>
heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in con-<lb/>
cert with peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such<lb/>
a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld,<lb/>
even in Persia, the home of the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy<lb/>
Philopater testified of the African elephant, I then testified of<lb/>
the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all beings.<lb/>
For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity<lb/>
often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the pro-<lb/>
foundest silence.</p>
<p>The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale<lb/>
and the elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one<lb/>
and the trunk of the other are concerned, should not tend to<lb/>
place those two opposite organs on an equality, much less the<lb/>
creatures to which they respectively belong. For as the might-<lb/>
iest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with<lb/>
Leviathan&#x0027;s tail, his trunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most<lb/>
direful blow from the elephant&#x0027;s trunk were as the playful tap<lb/>
of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash of the<lb/>
sperm whale&#x0027;s ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances<lb/>
have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars<lb/>
and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses<lb/>
his balls.<note xml:id="fn18-421"><p>Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the<lb/>
whale and the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular<lb/>
the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog<lb/>
does to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of<lb/>
curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the<lb/>
elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating<lb/>
it, jet it forth in a stream.</p></note></p>
<p>The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore<lb/>
my inability to express it. At times there are gestures in it,<lb/>
which, though they would well grace the hand of man, remain<lb/>
wholly inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occa-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n459" n="422"/>
sionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters<lb/>
who have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols;<lb/>
that the whale, indeed, by these methods intelligently conversed<lb/>
with the world. Nor are there wanting other motions of the<lb/>
whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and unaccounta-<lb/>
ble to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may,<lb/>
then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But<lb/>
if I know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his<lb/>
head? much more, how comprehend his face, when face he has<lb/>
none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he seems to<lb/>
say, but my face shall not be seen. But I cannot completely<lb/>
make out his back parts; and hint what he will about his face,<lb/>
I say again he has no face.</p>

wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with<lb/>
which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it<lb/>
seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by<lb/>
the very formation of the land, should at least bear the appear-<lb/>
ance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping<lb/>
western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsup-<lb/>
plied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entran-<lb/>
ces to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike<lb/>
the Danes, these Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage<lb/>
of lowered top-sails from the endless procession of ships before<lb/>
the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by day, have<lb/>
passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with<lb/>
the costliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a<lb/>
ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce their claim<lb/>
to more solid tribute.</p>
<p>Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking<lb/>
among the low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied<lb/>
out upon the vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demand-<lb/>
ing tribute at the point of their spears. Though by the<lb/>
repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands<lb/>
of European cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs has of late<lb/>
been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present day, we<lb/>
occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in<lb/>
those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.</p>
<p>With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh<lb/>
to these straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the<lb/>
Javan sea, and thence, cruising northwards, over waters known<lb/>
to be frequented here and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep<lb/>
inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of Japan,<lb/>
in time for the great whaling season there. By these means,<lb/>
the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n461" n="424"/>
Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descend-<lb/>
ing upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though every-<lb/>
where else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving<lb/>
battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent;<lb/>
and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed<lb/>
to be haunting it.</p>
<p>But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land?<lb/>
does his crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay.<lb/>
For a long time, now, the circus-running sun has raced within<lb/>
his fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but what&#x0027;s in himself.<lb/>
So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls<lb/>
are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign<lb/>
wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but<lb/>
herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a<lb/>
whole lake&#x0027;s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted<lb/>
with utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and<lb/>
kentledge. She carries years&#x0027; water in her. Clear old prime<lb/>
Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the Nantuck-<lb/>
eter, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid, but<lb/>
yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams.<lb/>
Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China<lb/>
from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports,<lb/>
the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one<lb/>
grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen<lb/>
like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that<lb/>
another flood had come; they would only answer&#x2014; &#x201C;Well, boys,<lb/>
here&#x0027;s the ark!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the<lb/>
western coast of Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda;<lb/>
indeed, as most of the ground, roundabout, was generally recog-<lb/>
nised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising; there-<lb/>
fore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head,<lb/>
the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep<lb/>
wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the land<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n462" n="425"/>
soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils<lb/>
the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet<lb/>
was descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with<lb/>
any game hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits,<lb/>
when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere<lb/>
long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us.</p>
<p>But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity<lb/>
with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans,<lb/>
the Sperm Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small<lb/>
detached companies, as in former times, are now frequently met<lb/>
with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multi-<lb/>
tude, that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them<lb/>
had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance<lb/>
and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into<lb/>
such immense caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that<lb/>
even in the best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail<lb/>
for weeks and months together, without being greeted by a<lb/>
single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes<lb/>
seems thousands on thousands.</p>
<p>Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three<lb/>
miles, and forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the<lb/>
level horizon, a continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing<lb/>
and sparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpen-<lb/>
dicular twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall<lb/>
over in two branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow,<lb/>
the single forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents<lb/>
a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising and falling<lb/>
away to leeward.</p>
<p>Seen from the Pequod&#x0027;s deck, then, as she would rise on a<lb/>
high hill of the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually cur-<lb/>
ling up into the air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere<lb/>
of bluish haze, showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of<lb/>
some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning,<lb/>
by some horseman on a height.</p>
<pb xml:id="n463" n="426"/>
<p>As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the<lb/>
mountains, accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that<lb/>
perilous passage in their rear, and once more expand in compa-<lb/>
rative security upon the plain; even so did this vast fleet of<lb/>
whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits;<lb/>
gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and swim-<lb/>
ming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.</p>
<p>Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the<lb/>
harpooneers handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from<lb/>
the heads of their yet suspended boats. If the wind only held,<lb/>
little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of Sunda,<lb/>
the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness<lb/>
the capture of not a few of their number. And who could tell<lb/>
whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might<lb/>
not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-<lb/>
elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with<lb/>
stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these<lb/>
leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego<lb/>
was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our wake.</p>
<p>Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another<lb/>
in our rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising<lb/>
and falling something like the spouts of the whales; only they<lb/>
did not so completely come and go; for they constantly hovered,<lb/>
without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight,<lb/>
Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, &#x201C;Aloft there,<lb/>
and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;&#x2014;Malays, sir, and<lb/>
after us!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod<lb/>
should fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were<lb/>
now in hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay.<lb/>
But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was<lb/>
herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny philanthro-<lb/>
pists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,&#x2014;<lb/>
mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As with<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n464" n="427"/>
glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward<lb/>
turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one<lb/>
the bloodthirsty pirates chasing <hi rend="i">him;</hi> some such fancy as the<lb/>
above seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls<lb/>
of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and<lb/>
bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his<lb/>
vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was<lb/>
now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and not<lb/>
only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman<lb/>
atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their<lb/>
curses;&#x2014;when all these conceits had passed through his brain,<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand<lb/>
beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being<lb/>
able to drag the firm thing from its place.</p>
<p>But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew;<lb/>
and when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern,<lb/>
the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on<lb/>
the Sumatra side, emerging at last upon the broad waters<lb/>
beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the<lb/>
swift whales had been gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice<lb/>
that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the Malays. But<lb/>
still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed<lb/>
abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the<lb/>
wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats.<lb/>
But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct<lb/>
of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three keels that<lb/>
were after them,&#x2014;though as yet a mile in their rear,&#x2014;than<lb/>
they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions,<lb/>
so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked<lb/>
bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.</p>
<p>Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-<lb/>
ash, and after several hours&#x0027; pulling were almost disposed to<lb/>
renounce the chase, when a general pausing commotion among<lb/>
the whales gave animating token that they were now at last<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n465" n="428"/>
under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolu-<lb/>
tion, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they<lb/>
say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they<lb/>
had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now<lb/>
broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus&#x0027; ele-<lb/>
phants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going<lb/>
mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast<lb/>
irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither,<lb/>
by their short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their dis-<lb/>
traction of panic. This was still more strangely evinced by<lb/>
those of their number, who, completely paralysed as it were,<lb/>
helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea.<lb/>
Had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued<lb/>
over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly<lb/>
have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional<lb/>
timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though<lb/>
banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes<lb/>
of the West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness,<lb/>
too, all human beings, how when herded together in the sheep-<lb/>
fold of a theatre&#x0027;s pit, they will, at the slightest alarm of fire,<lb/>
rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming,<lb/>
and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best, therefore,<lb/>
withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before<lb/>
us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not<lb/>
infinitely outdone by the madness of men.</p>
<p>Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent<lb/>
motion, yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither<lb/>
advanced nor retreated, but collectively remained in one place.<lb/>
As is customary in those cases, the boats at once separated, each<lb/>
making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal.<lb/>
In about three minutes&#x0027; time, Queequeg&#x0027;s harpoon was flung;<lb/>
the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then<lb/>
running away with us like light, steered straight for the heart<lb/>
of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n466" n="429"/>
whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unpre-<lb/>
cedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;<lb/>
yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the<lb/>
fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper<lb/>
into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only<lb/>
exist in a delirious throb.</p>
<p>As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer<lb/>
power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had<lb/>
fastened to him; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on<lb/>
all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed creatures to and<lb/>
fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by<lb/>
ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer through their com-<lb/>
plicated channels and straits, knowing not at what moment it<lb/>
may be locked in and crushed.</p>
<p>But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now<lb/>
sheering off from this monster directly across our route in ad-<lb/>
vance; now edging away from that, whose colossal flukes were<lb/>
suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood up in<lb/>
the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever<lb/>
whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to<lb/>
make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though<lb/>
their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They<lb/>
chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business. &#x201C;Out<lb/>
of the way, Commodore!&#x201D; cried one, to a great dromedary that<lb/>
of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant threat-<lb/>
ened to swamp us. &#x201C;Hard down with your tail, there!&#x201D; cried<lb/>
a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly<lb/>
cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.</p>
<p>All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally<lb/>
invented by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick<lb/>
squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so<lb/>
that they cross each other&#x0027;s grain at right angles; a line of con-<lb/>
siderable length is then attached to the middle of this block, and<lb/>
the other end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n467" n="430"/>
fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that<lb/>
this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you<lb/>
than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are<lb/>
not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill<lb/>
all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must<lb/>
wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.<lb/>
Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg comes into<lb/>
requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The<lb/>
first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales<lb/>
staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong<lb/>
resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like male-<lb/>
factors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in<lb/>
the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught<lb/>
under one of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out<lb/>
and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat&#x0027;s bottom<lb/>
as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came in<lb/>
at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and<lb/>
shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.</p>
<p>It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-har-<lb/>
poons, were it not that as we advanced into the herd, our<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s way greatly diminished; moreover, that as we went still<lb/>
further and further from the circumference of commotion, the<lb/>
direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the<lb/>
jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways van-<lb/>
ished; then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum,<lb/>
we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the<lb/>
shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a<lb/>
serene valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens be-<lb/>
tween the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In this<lb/>
central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,<lb/>
called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the<lb/>
whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that<lb/>
enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every com-<lb/>
motion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n468" n="431"/>
tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods<lb/>
of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,<lb/>
like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder<lb/>
to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-<lb/>
arched the middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs.<lb/>
Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales, more<lb/>
immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no pos-<lb/>
sible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must<lb/>
watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the<lb/>
wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keep-<lb/>
ing at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by<lb/>
small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this<lb/>
routed host.</p>
<p>Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the<lb/>
revolving outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the<lb/>
various pods in any one of those circles, the entire area at this<lb/>
juncture, embraced by the whole multitude, must have contained<lb/>
at least two or three square miles. At any rate&#x2014;though indeed<lb/>
such a test at such a time might be deceptive&#x2014;spoutings might<lb/>
be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost<lb/>
from the rim of the horizon. I mention this circumstance,<lb/>
because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up<lb/>
in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd<lb/>
had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of<lb/>
its stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and<lb/>
every way innocent and inexperienced; however it may have<lb/>
been, these smaller whales&#x2014;now and then visiting our becalmed<lb/>
boat from the margin of the lake&#x2014;evinced a wondrous fearless-<lb/>
ness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it<lb/>
was impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they<lb/>
came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching<lb/>
them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly<lb/>
domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Star-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n469" n="432"/>
buck scratched their backs with his lance; but fearful of the<lb/>
consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.</p>
<p>But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface,<lb/>
another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over<lb/>
the side. For, suspended in those watery vaults, floated the<lb/>
forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and those that by<lb/>
their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. The<lb/>
lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly<lb/>
transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly<lb/>
and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two differ-<lb/>
ent lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,<lb/>
be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;&#x2014;<lb/>
even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards<lb/>
us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulf-weed in their<lb/>
new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the mothers also<lb/>
seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little infants, that from<lb/>
certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might have<lb/>
measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in<lb/>
girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed<lb/>
scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately<lb/>
occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all<lb/>
ready for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a<lb/>
Tartar&#x0027;s bow. The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes,<lb/>
still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby&#x0027;s<lb/>
ears newly arrived from foreign parts.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Line! line!&#x201D; cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale;<lb/>
&#x201C;him fast! him fast!&#x2014;Who line him! Who struck?&#x2014;Two<lb/>
whale; one big, one little!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What ails ye, man?&#x201D; cried Starbuck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look-e here,&#x201D; said Queequeg pointing down.</p>
<p>As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out<lb/>
hundreds of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats<lb/>
up again, and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n470" n="433"/>
and spiralling towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils<lb/>
of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young<lb/>
cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid<lb/>
vicisitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the maternal end<lb/>
loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub<lb/>
is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas<lb/>
seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young<lb/>
Leviathan amours in the deep.<note xml:id="fn19-433"><p>The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but<lb/>
unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gesta-<lb/>
tion which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at<lb/>
a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and<lb/>
Jacob:&#x2014;a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously<lb/>
situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves extend<lb/>
upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a nursing<lb/>
whale are cut by the hunter&#x0027;s lance, the mother&#x0027;s pouring milk and blood<lb/>
rivallingly discolor the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it<lb/>
has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries. When over-<lb/>
flowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute <hi rend="i">more hominum.</hi></p></note></p>
<p>And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of conster-<lb/>
nations and affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the<lb/>
centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments;<lb/>
yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and delight. But even so,<lb/>
amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself still for<lb/>
ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets<lb/>
of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland<lb/>
there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden<lb/>
frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the<lb/>
other boats, still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier<lb/>
of the host; or possibly carrying on the war within the first<lb/>
circle, where abundance of room and some convenient retreats<lb/>
were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged drugged<lb/>
whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the<lb/>
circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is some-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n471" n="434"/>
times the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly<lb/>
powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by<lb/>
sundering or maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by<lb/>
darting a short-handled cutting-spade, to which is attached a<lb/>
rope for hauling it back again. A whale wounded (as we after-<lb/>
wards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it seemed,<lb/>
had broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half<lb/>
of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the<lb/>
wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the<lb/>
lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, car-<lb/>
rying dismay wherever he went.</p>
<p>But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appal-<lb/>
ling spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with<lb/>
which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to<lb/>
a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us.<lb/>
But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable<lb/>
accidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in the<lb/>
harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the<lb/>
cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope attached<lb/>
to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the har-<lb/>
poon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked<lb/>
loose from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was<lb/>
now churning through the water, violently flailing with his flex-<lb/>
ible tail, and tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and<lb/>
murdering his own comrades.</p>
<p>This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their<lb/>
stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our<lb/>
lake began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as<lb/>
if lifted by half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself<lb/>
began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers<lb/>
and nurseries vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the<lb/>
whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening<lb/>
clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing<lb/>
hum was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n472" n="435"/>
of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring,<lb/>
the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre,<lb/>
as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly<lb/>
Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the<lb/>
stern.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oars! Oars!&#x201D; he intensely whispered, seizing the helm&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;gripe your oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men,<lb/>
stand by! Shove him off, you Queequeg&#x2014;the whale there!<lb/>
&#x2014;prick him!&#x2014;hit him! Stand up&#x2014;stand up, and stay so!<lb/>
Spring, men&#x2014;pull, men; never mind their backs&#x2014;scrape them!<lb/>
&#x2014;scrape away!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black<lb/>
bulks, leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths.<lb/>
But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary<lb/>
opening; then giving way rapidly, and at the same time earnestly<lb/>
watching for another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth<lb/>
escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one<lb/>
of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales, all<lb/>
violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was<lb/>
cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg&#x0027;s hat, who, while<lb/>
standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat<lb/>
taken clean from his head by the air-eddy made by the sudden<lb/>
tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by.</p>
<p>Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was,<lb/>
it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement;<lb/>
for having clumped together at last in one dense body, they then<lb/>
renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further<lb/>
pursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their wake to<lb/>
pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern, and<lb/>
likewise to secure one which Flask had killed and waifed. The<lb/>
waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which are carried by<lb/>
every boat; and which, when additional game is at hand, are<lb/>
inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n473" n="436"/>
mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,<lb/>
should the boats of any other ship draw near.</p>
<p>The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that<lb/>
sagacious saying in the Fishery,&#x2014;the more whales the less fish.<lb/>
Of all the drugged whales only one was captured. The rest<lb/>
contrived to escape for the time, but only to be taken, as will<lb/>
hereafter be seen, by some other craft than the Pequod.</p>

<hi rend="sc">schools and schoolmasters</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> previous chapter gave account of an immense body or<lb/>
herd of Sperm Whales, and there was also then given the pro-<lb/>
bable cause inducing those vast aggregations.</p>
<p>Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet,<lb/>
as must have been seen, even at the present day, small detached<lb/>
bands are occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty<lb/>
individuals each. Such bands are known as schools. They<lb/>
generally are of two sorts; those composed almost entirely of<lb/>
females, and those mustering none but young vigorous males,<lb/>
or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.</p>
<p>In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you inva-<lb/>
riably see a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who,<lb/>
upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and<lb/>
covering the flight of his ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a<lb/>
luxurious Ottoman, swimming about over the watery world,<lb/>
surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments<lb/>
of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his con-<lb/>
cubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest<lb/>
leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not<lb/>
more than one third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n474" n="437"/>
are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed<lb/>
half a dozen yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be<lb/>
denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to<lb/>
<hi rend="i">en bon point.</hi></p>
<p>It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their<lb/>
indolent ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on<lb/>
the move in leisurely search of variety. You meet them on the<lb/>
Line in time for the full flower of the Equatorial feeding season,<lb/>
having just returned, perhaps, from spending the summer in the<lb/>
Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all unpleasant<lb/>
weariness and warmth. By the time they have lounged up<lb/>
and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for<lb/>
the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and<lb/>
so evade the other excessive temperature of the year.</p>
<p>When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any<lb/>
strange suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary<lb/>
eye on his interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert<lb/>
young Leviathan coming that way, presume to draw confiden-<lb/>
tially close to one of the ladies, with what prodigious fury the<lb/>
Bashaw assails him, and chases him away! High times, in-<lb/>
deed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to<lb/>
invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the<lb/>
Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out<lb/>
of his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the<lb/>
ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival ad-<lb/>
mirers; just so with the whales, who sometimes come to deadly<lb/>
battle, and all for love. They fence with their long lower jaws,<lb/>
sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the supre-<lb/>
macy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a<lb/>
few are captured having the deep sears of these encounters,&#x2014;<lb/>
furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some in-<lb/>
stances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.</p>
<p>But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake him-<lb/>
self away at the first rush of the harem&#x0027;s lord, then is it very<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n475" n="438"/>
diverting to watch that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk<lb/>
among them again and revels there awhile, still in tantalizing<lb/>
vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worship-<lb/>
ping among his thousand concubines. Granting other whales<lb/>
to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of<lb/>
these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish of their<lb/>
strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the<lb/>
sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daugh-<lb/>
ters must take care of themselves; at least, with only the ma-<lb/>
ternal help. For like certain other omnivorous roving lovers<lb/>
that might be named, my Lord Whale has no taste for the<lb/>
nursery, however much for the bower; and so, being a great<lb/>
traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the<lb/>
world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless,<lb/>
as the ardor of youth declines; as years and dumps in-<lb/>
crease; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a<lb/>
general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease<lb/>
and virtue supplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters<lb/>
upon the impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life, for-<lb/>
swears, disbands the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky<lb/>
old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels<lb/>
saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from his<lb/>
amorous errors.</p>
<p>Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a<lb/>
school, so is the lord and master of that school technically known<lb/>
as the schoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, how-<lb/>
ever admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he<lb/>
should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there,<lb/>
but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally<lb/>
seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself,<lb/>
but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled<lb/>
this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of<lb/>
Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a country-school-<lb/>
master that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n476" n="439"/>
what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into<lb/>
some of his pupils.</p>
<p>The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster<lb/>
whale betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged<lb/>
Sperm Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale&#x2014;as a solitary<lb/>
Leviathan is called&#x2014;proves an ancient one. Like venerable<lb/>
moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one near him but<lb/>
Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of<lb/>
waters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps so many<lb/>
moody secrets.</p>
<p>The schools composing none but young and vigorous males,<lb/>
previously mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools.<lb/>
For while those female whales are characteristically timid, the<lb/>
young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far<lb/>
the most pugnacious of all Leviathans, and proverbially the<lb/>
most dangerous to encounter; excepting those wondrous grey-<lb/>
headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met, and these will fight<lb/>
you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.</p>
<p>The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem<lb/>
schools. Like a mob of young collegians, they are full of fight,<lb/>
fun, and wickedness, tumbling round the world at such a reck-<lb/>
less, rollicking rate, that no prudent underwriter would insure<lb/>
them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard.<lb/>
They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when about<lb/>
three fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest<lb/>
of settlements, that is, harems.</p>
<p>Another point of difference between the male and female<lb/>
schools is still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike<lb/>
a Forty-barrel-bull&#x2014;poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But<lb/>
strike a member of the harem school, and her companions swim<lb/>
around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so<lb/>
near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.</p>

<hi rend="sc">fast-fish and loose-fish</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> allusion to the waifs and waif-poles in the last chapter<lb/>
but one, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations<lb/>
of the whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the<lb/>
grand symbol and badge.</p>
<p>It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in<lb/>
company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape,<lb/>
and be finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein<lb/>
are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking<lb/>
of this one grand feature. For example,&#x2014;after a weary and<lb/>
perilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose<lb/>
from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and drifting far<lb/>
away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a<lb/>
calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus<lb/>
the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise<lb/>
between the fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten,<lb/>
universal, undisputed law applicable to all cases.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislat-<lb/>
ive enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the<lb/>
States-General in A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has<lb/>
ever had any written whaling law, yet the American fishermen<lb/>
have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter.<lb/>
They have provided a system which for terse comprehensive-<lb/>
ness surpasses Justinian&#x0027;s Pandects and the By-laws of the<lb/>
Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other<lb/>
People&#x0027;s Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a<lb/>
Queen Anne&#x0027;s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn<lb/>
round the neck, so small are they.</p>
<pb xml:id="n478" n="441"/>
<p>I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.</p>
<p>II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest<lb/>
catch it.</p>
<p>But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the<lb/>
admirable brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of com-<lb/>
mentaries to expound it.</p>
<p>First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is techni-<lb/>
cally fast, when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat,<lb/>
by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occu-<lb/>
pants,&#x2014;a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a<lb/>
strand of cobweb, it is all the same. Likewise a fish is techni-<lb/>
cally fast when it bears a waif, or any other recognised symbol<lb/>
of possession; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their<lb/>
ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as their inten-<lb/>
tion so to do.</p>
<p>These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of<lb/>
the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and<lb/>
harder knocks&#x2014;the Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True,<lb/>
among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances<lb/>
are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an outra-<lb/>
geous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a<lb/>
whale previously chased or killed by another party. But others<lb/>
are by no means so scrupulous.</p>
<p>Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover<lb/>
litigated in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a<lb/>
hard chase of a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed<lb/>
they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in harpooning the fish; they<lb/>
were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged to forsake not<lb/>
only their lines, but their boat itself. Ultimately the defendants<lb/>
(the crew of another ship) came up with the whale, struck,<lb/>
killed, seized, and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of<lb/>
the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were remonstrated<lb/>
with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs&#x0027; teeth,<lb/>
and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n479" n="442"/>
done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which<lb/>
had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure.<lb/>
Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the<lb/>
value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat.</p>
<p>Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellen-<lb/>
borough was the judge. In the course of the defence, the witty<lb/>
Erskine went on to illustrate his position, by alluding to a<lb/>
recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying<lb/>
to bridle his wife&#x0027;s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon<lb/>
the seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of that<lb/>
step, he instituted an action to recover possession of her. Ers-<lb/>
kine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying,<lb/>
that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady,<lb/>
and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great<lb/>
stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her;<lb/>
yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and<lb/>
therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the<lb/>
lady then became that subsequent gentleman&#x0027;s property, along<lb/>
with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in<lb/>
her.</p>
<p>Now in the present case Erskine contended that the exam-<lb/>
ples of the whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative<lb/>
of each other.</p>
<p>These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard,<lb/>
the very learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,&#x2014;That as<lb/>
for the boat, he awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had<lb/>
merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that with regard to<lb/>
the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the<lb/>
defendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time<lb/>
of the final capture; and the harpoons and line because when<lb/>
the fish made off with them, it (the fish) acquired a property in<lb/>
those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards took the<lb/>
fish had a right to them. Now the plaintiffs afterwards took<lb/>
the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.</p>
<pb xml:id="n480" n="443"/>
<p>A common man looking at this decision of the very learned<lb/>
Judge, might possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the<lb/>
primary rock of the matter, the two great principles laid down<lb/>
in the twin whaling laws previously quoted, and applied and<lb/>
elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case; these<lb/>
two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will, on<lb/>
reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human jurispru-<lb/>
dence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture,<lb/>
the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has<lb/>
but two props to stand on.</p>
<p>Is it not a saying in every one&#x0027;s mouth, Possession is half of<lb/>
the law: that is, regardless of how the thing came into pos-<lb/>
session? But often possession is the whole of the law. What<lb/>
are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and Republican slaves<lb/>
but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law?<lb/>
What to the rapacious landlord is the widow&#x0027;s last mite but a<lb/>
Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain&#x0027;s marble<lb/>
mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-<lb/>
Fish? What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the<lb/>
broker, gets from poor Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to<lb/>
keep Woebegone&#x0027;s family from starvation; what is that ruinous<lb/>
discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the Archbishop of Save-<lb/>
soul&#x0027;s income of &#x00A3;100,000 seized from the scant bread and<lb/>
cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all<lb/>
sure of heaven without any of Savesoul&#x0027;s help) what is that<lb/>
globular 100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of<lb/>
Dunder&#x0027;s hereditary towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What<lb/>
to that redoubted harpooneer, John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a<lb/>
Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer, Brother Jonathan,<lb/>
is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is not<lb/>
Possession the whole of the law?</p>
<p>But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applica-<lb/>
ble, the kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so.<lb/>
That is internationally and universally applicable.</p>
<pb xml:id="n481" n="444"/>
<p>What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which<lb/>
Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of waifing it<lb/>
for his royal master and mistress? What was Poland to the<lb/>
Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to England?<lb/>
What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-<lb/>
Fish.</p>
<p>What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World<lb/>
but Loose-Fish? What all men&#x0027;s minds and opinions but<lb/>
Loose-Fish? What is the principle of religious belief in them<lb/>
but a Loose-Fish? What to the ostentatious smuggling<lb/>
verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose-Fish? What<lb/>
is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what are you,<lb/>

<p><hi rend="sc">Latin</hi> from the books of the Laws of England, which taken<lb/>

anybody on the coast of that land, the King, as Honorary<lb/>
Grand Harpooneer, must have the head, and the Queen be<lb/>
respectfully presented with the tail. A division which, in the<lb/>
whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate<lb/>
remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this<lb/>
day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects a<lb/>
strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-<lb/>
Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same<lb/>
courteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at<lb/>
the expense of a separate car, specially reserved for the accommo-<lb/>
dation of royalty. In the first place, in curious proof of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n482" n="445"/>
fact that the above-mentioned law is still in force, I proceed to<lb/>
lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last<lb/>
two years.</p>
<p>It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or<lb/>
Sandwich, or some one of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded<lb/>
in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally<lb/>
descried afar off from the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially<lb/>
or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle,<lb/>
called a Lord Warden. Holding the office directly from the<lb/>
crown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque<lb/>
Port territories become by assignment his. By some writers<lb/>
this office is called a sinecure. But not so. Because the Lord<lb/>
Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites;<lb/>
which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them.</p>
<p>Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and<lb/>
with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wear-<lb/>
ily hauled their fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a<lb/>
good &#x00A3;150 from the precious oil and bone; and in fantasy<lb/>
sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their<lb/>
cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up steps a<lb/>
very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with<lb/>
a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s head, he says&#x2014; &#x201C;Hands off! this fish, my masters, is a<lb/>
Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden&#x0027;s.&#x201D; Upon this the<lb/>
poor mariners in their respectful consternation&#x2014;so truly English<lb/>
mdash;knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their<lb/>
heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale<lb/>
to the stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at<lb/>
all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the<lb/>
copy of Blackstone. At length one of them, after long scrateh-<lb/>
ing about for his ideas, made bold to speak.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Duke.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n483" n="446"/>
<p>&#x201C;It is his.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some<lb/>
expense, and is all that to go to the Duke&#x0027;s benefit; we getting<lb/>
nothing at all for our pains but our blisters?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is his.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate<lb/>
mode of getting a livelihood?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is his.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of<lb/>
my share of this whale.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is his.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Won&#x0027;t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is his.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the<lb/>
Duke of Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed<lb/>
in some particular lights, the case might by a bare possibility in<lb/>
some small degree be deemed, under the circumstances, a rather<lb/>
hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respectfully ad-<lb/>
dressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take the case of<lb/>
those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which my<lb/>
Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)<lb/>
that he had already done so, and received the money, and<lb/>
would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he<lb/>
(the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling with other<lb/>
people&#x0027;s business. Is this the still militant old man, standing<lb/>
at the corners of the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms<lb/>
of beggars?</p>
<p>It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of<lb/>
the Duke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign.<lb/>
We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is<lb/>
originally invested with that right. The law itself has already<lb/>
been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the reason for it. Says<lb/>
Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and<lb/>
Queen, &#x201C;because of its superior excellence.&#x201D; And by the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n484" n="447"/>
soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argu-<lb/>
ment in such matters.</p>
<p>But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the<lb/>
tail? A reason for that, ye lawyers!</p>
<p>In his treatise on &#x201C;Queen-Gold,&#x201D; or Queen-pinmoney, an old<lb/>
King&#x0027;s Bench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth:<lb/>
&#x201C;Ye tail is ye Queen&#x0027;s, that ye Queen&#x0027;s warbrobe may be sup-<lb/>
plied with ye whalebone.&#x201D; Now this was written at a time<lb/>
when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale<lb/>
was largely used in ladies&#x0027; bodices. But this same bone is not<lb/>
in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a saga-<lb/>
cious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be<lb/>
presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.</p>
<p>There are two royal fish so styled by the English law<lb/>
writers&#x2014;the whale and the sturgeon; both royal property under<lb/>
certain limitations, and nominally supplying the tenth branch<lb/>
of the crown&#x0027;s ordinary revenue. I know not that any other<lb/>
author has hinted of the matter; but by inference it seems to<lb/>
me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the<lb/>
whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head<lb/>
peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly<lb/>
be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality.<lb/>
And thus there seems a reason in all things, even in law.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I will bet something now,&#x201D; said Stubb, &#x201C;that somewhere<lb/>
hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the<lb/>
other day. I thought they would keel up before long.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the<lb/>
distance lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort<lb/>
of whale must be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger<lb/>
showed French colors from his peak; and by the eddying cloud<lb/>
of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped<lb/>
around him, it was plain that the whale alongside must be what<lb/>
the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has<lb/>
died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated<lb/>
corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such<lb/>
a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,<lb/>
when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intole-<lb/>
rable indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could per-<lb/>
suade them to moor alongside of it. Yet are there those who<lb/>
will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained<lb/>
from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means<lb/>
of the nature of attar-of-rose.</p>
<p>Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the<lb/>
Frenchman had a second whale alongside; and this second<lb/>
whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first. In truth,<lb/>
it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem<lb/>
to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or indi-<lb/>
gestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt<lb/>
of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall<lb/>
see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at<lb/>
such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted whales<lb/>
in general.</p>
<p>The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb<lb/>
vowed he recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n486" n="449"/>
lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these<lb/>
whales.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x0027;s a pretty fellow, now,&#x201D; he banteringly laughed,<lb/>
standing in the ship&#x0027;s bows, &#x201C;there&#x0027;s a jackal for ye! I well<lb/>
know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in<lb/>
the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mis-<lb/>
taking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sail-<lb/>
ing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow<lb/>
candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they<lb/>
will get won&#x0027;t be enough to dip the Captain&#x0027;s wick into; aye,<lb/>
we all know these things; but look ye, here&#x0027;s a Crappo that is<lb/>
content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean;<lb/>
aye, and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that<lb/>
other precious fish he has there. Poor devil! I say, pass round<lb/>
a hat, some one, and let&#x0027;s make him a present of a little oil for<lb/>
dear charity&#x0027;s sake. For what oil he&#x0027;ll get from that drugged<lb/>
whale there, wouldn&#x0027;t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a con-<lb/>
demned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I&#x0027;ll agree to<lb/>
get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts<lb/>
of ours, than he&#x0027;ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now<lb/>
that I think of it, it may contain something worth a good deal<lb/>
more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man<lb/>
has thought of that. It&#x0027;s worth trying. Yes, I&#x0027;m in for it;&#x201D;<lb/>
and so saying he started for the quarter-deck.</p>
<p>By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so<lb/>
that whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the<lb/>
smell, with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up<lb/>
again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his boat&#x0027;s<lb/>
crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow,<lb/>
he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste,<lb/>
the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a<lb/>
huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had<lb/>
copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole<lb/>
terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n487" n="450"/>
Upon her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read &#x201C;Bouton<lb/>
de Rose,&#x201D;&#x2014;Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic<lb/>
name of this aromatic ship.</p>
<p>Though Stubb did not understand the <hi rend="i">Bouton</hi> part of the<lb/>
inscription, yet the word <hi rend="i">rose</hi>, and the bulbous figure-head put<lb/>
together, sufficiently explained the whole to him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A wooden rose-bud, eh?&#x201D; he cried with his hand to his nose,<lb/>
&#x201C;that will do very well; but how like all creation it smells!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now in order to hold direct communication with the<lb/>
people on deck, he had to pull round the bows to the starboard<lb/>
side, and thus come close to the blasted whale; and so talk<lb/>
over it.</p>
<p>Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he bawled&#x2014; &#x201D;Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak English?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who<lb/>
turned out to be the chief-mate.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the<lb/>
White Whale?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="i">What</hi> whale?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The <hi rend="i">White</hi> Whale&#x2014;a Sperm Whale&#x2014;Moby Dick, have ye<lb/>
seen him?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White<lb/>
Whale&#x2014;no.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Very good, then; good bye now, and I&#x0027;ll call again in a<lb/>
minute.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing<lb/>
Ahab leaning over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he<lb/>
moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted&#x2014;&#x201C;No, Sir!<lb/>
No!&#x201D; Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the<lb/>
Frenchman.</p>
<p>He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got<lb/>
into the chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his<lb/>
nose in a sort of bag.</p>
<pb xml:id="n488" n="451"/>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s the matter with your nose, there?&#x201D; said Stubb.<lb/>
&#x201C;Broke it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I wish it was broken, or that I didn&#x0027;t have any nose at all!&#x201D;<lb/>
answered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job<lb/>
he was at very much. &#x201C;But what are you holding <hi rend="i">yours</hi> for?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, nothing! It&#x0027;s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine<lb/>
day, aint it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a<lb/>
bunch of posies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What in the devil&#x0027;s name do you want here?&#x201D; roared the<lb/>
Guernsey-man, flying into a sudden passion.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! keep cool&#x2014;cool? yes, that&#x0027;s the word; why don&#x0027;t you<lb/>
pack those whales in ice while you&#x0027;re working at &#x0027;em? But<lb/>
joking aside, though; do you know, Rose-bud, that it&#x0027;s all non-<lb/>
sense trying to get any oil out of such whales? As for that<lb/>
dried up one, there, he hasn&#x0027;t a gill in his whole carcase.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know that well enough; but, d&#x0027;ye see, the Captain<lb/>
here won&#x0027;t believe it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne<lb/>
manufacturer before. But come aboard, and mayhap he&#x0027;ll be-<lb/>
lieve you, if he won&#x0027;t me; and so I&#x0027;ll get out of this dirty<lb/>
scrape.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,&#x201D; re-<lb/>
joined Stubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck.<lb/>
There a queer scene presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled<lb/>
caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness<lb/>
for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very<lb/>
fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their<lb/>
noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-<lb/>
booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work,<lb/>
and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thin-<lb/>
king they would catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and<lb/>
at intervals held it to their nostrils. Others having broken the<lb/>
stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl, were vigorously<lb/>
puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly filled their olfacto-<lb/>
ries.</p>
<pb xml:id="n489" n="452"/>
<p>Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas pro-<lb/>
ceeding from the Captain&#x0027;s round-house abaft; and looking in<lb/>
that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door, which<lb/>
was held ajar from within. This was the tormented surgeon,<lb/>
who, after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the<lb/>
day, had betaken himself to the Captain&#x0027;s round-house (<hi rend="i">cabinet</hi><lb/>
he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help yelling<lb/>
out his entreaties and indignations at times.</p>
<p>Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and tur-<lb/>
ning to the Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during<lb/>
which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Cap-<lb/>
tain as a conceited ignoramus, who had brought them all into so<lb/>
unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him carefully,<lb/>
Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the<lb/>
slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held<lb/>
his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and con-<lb/>
fidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little<lb/>
plan for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without<lb/>
his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to<lb/>
this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an<lb/>
interpreter&#x0027;s office, was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but<lb/>
as coming from Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any<lb/>
nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the inter-<lb/>
view.</p>
<p>By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin.<lb/>
He was a small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a<lb/>
sea-captain, with large whiskers and moustache, however; and<lb/>
wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at his side. To<lb/>
this gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by the<lb/>
Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of<lb/>
interpreting between them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What shall I say to him first?&#x201D; said he.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why,&#x201D; said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch<lb/>
and seals, &#x201C;you may as well begin by telling him that he looks<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n490" n="453"/>
a sort of babyish to me, though I don&#x0027;t pretend to be a<lb/>
judge.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He says, Monsieur,&#x201D; said the Guernsey-man, in French,<lb/>
turning to his captain, &#x201C;that only yesterday his ship spoke<lb/>
a vessel, whose captain and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all<lb/>
died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought<lb/>
alongside.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know<lb/>
more.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What now?&#x201D; said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have<lb/>
eyed him carefully, I&#x0027;m quite certain that he&#x0027;s no more fit<lb/>
to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell<lb/>
him from me he&#x0027;s a baboon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the<lb/>
dried one, is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine,<lb/>
Monsieur, he conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from<lb/>
these fish.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice com-<lb/>
manded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and<lb/>
at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to<lb/>
the ship.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What now?&#x201D; said the Guernsey-man, when the captain had<lb/>
returned to them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that<lb/>
&#x2014;that&#x2014;in fact, tell him I&#x0027;ve diddled him, and (aside to him-<lb/>
self) perhaps somebody else.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He says, Monsieur, that he&#x0027;s very happy to have been<lb/>
of any service to us.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful<lb/>
parties (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting<lb/>
Stubb down into his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,&#x201D; said the<lb/>
interpreter.</p>
<pb xml:id="n491" n="454"/>
<p>&#x201C;Thank him heartily; but tell him it&#x0027;s against my prin-<lb/>
ciples to drink with the man I&#x0027;ve diddled. In fact, tell him<lb/>
I must go.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He says, Monsieur, that his principles won&#x0027;t admit of his<lb/>
drinking; but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to<lb/>
drink, then Monsieur had best drop all four boats, and pull the<lb/>
ship away from these whales, for it&#x0027;s so calm they won&#x0027;t<lb/>
drift.&#x201D;</p>
<p>By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into<lb/>
his boat, hailed the Guernsey-man to this effect,&#x2014;that having a<lb/>
long tow-line in his boat, he would do what he could to help<lb/>
them, by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the<lb/>
ship&#x0027;s side. While the Frenchman&#x0027;s boats, then, were engaged<lb/>
in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at<lb/>
his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most<lb/>
unusually long tow-line.</p>
<p>Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from<lb/>
the whale; hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased<lb/>
his distance, while the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb&#x0027;s<lb/>
whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body,<lb/>
and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at once<lb/>
proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning. Seizing<lb/>
his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the body,<lb/>
a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he<lb/>
was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length<lb/>
his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning<lb/>
up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam.<lb/>
His boat&#x0027;s crew were all in high excitement, eagerly helping<lb/>
their chief, and looking as anxious as gold-hunters.</p>
<p>And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking,<lb/>
and screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb<lb/>
was beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible<lb/>
nosegay increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of<lb/>
this plague, there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n492" n="455"/>
through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as<lb/>
one river will flow into and then along with another, without<lb/>
at all blending with it for a time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have it, I have it,&#x201D; cried Stubb, with delight, striking<lb/>
something in the subterranean regions, &#x201C;a purse! a purse!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out<lb/>
handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap,<lb/>
or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous and savory withal.<lb/>
You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue<lb/>
between yellow and ash color. And this, good friends, is amber-<lb/>
gris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six<lb/>
handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the<lb/>
sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not<lb/>
for impatient Ahab&#x0027;s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come<lb/>
on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.</p>

<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d92" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XCII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">ambergris</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Now</hi> this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so<lb/>
important as an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain<lb/>
Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was examined at the bar of the<lb/>
English House of Commons on that subject. For at that time,<lb/>
and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of<lb/>
ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned.<lb/>
Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for<lb/>
grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For<lb/>
amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in<lb/>
some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except<lb/>
upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle,<lb/>
odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads<lb/>
and ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fra-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n493" n="456"/>
grant and spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles,<lb/>
precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it<lb/>
in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that<lb/>
frankincense is carried to St. Peter&#x0027;s in Rome. Some wine mer-<lb/>
chants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.</p>
<p>Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen<lb/>
should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious<lb/>
bowels of a sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris<lb/>
is supposed to be the cause, and by others the effect, of the<lb/>
dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were<lb/>
hard to say, unless by administering three or four boat loads of<lb/>
Brandreth&#x0027;s pills, and then running out of harm&#x0027;s way, as labor-<lb/>
ers do in blasting rocks.</p>
<p>I have forgotten to say that there were found in this amber-<lb/>
gris, certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb<lb/>
thought might be sailors&#x0027; trousers buttons; but it afterwards<lb/>
turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small<lb/>
squid bones embalmed in that manner.</p>
<p>Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris<lb/>
should be found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing?<lb/>
Bethink thee of that saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about<lb/>
corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in dishonor,<lb/>
but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that saying<lb/>
of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also<lb/>
forget not the strange fact that of all things of ill-savor, Cologne-<lb/>
water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the worst</p>
<p>I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal,<lb/>
but cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made<lb/>
against whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already<lb/>
biased minds, might be considered as indirectly substantiated by<lb/>
what has been said of the Frenchman&#x0027;s two whales. Elsewhere<lb/>
in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that<lb/>
the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy<lb/>
business. But there is another thing to rebut. They hint that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n494" n="457"/>
all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma<lb/>
originate?</p>
<p>I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the<lb/>
Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries<lb/>
ago. Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now,<lb/>
try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done;<lb/>
but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through<lb/>
the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that man-<lb/>
ner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the sud-<lb/>
den and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding<lb/>
any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into<lb/>
the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the<lb/>
Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that<lb/>
arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the founda-<lb/>
tions of a Lying-in Hospital.</p>
<p>I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers<lb/>
may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Green-<lb/>
land, in former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh<lb/>
or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used by the<lb/>
learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a text-<lb/>
book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer, fat; berg,<lb/>
to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place<lb/>
for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, with-<lb/>
out being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a<lb/>
collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the<lb/>
works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very<lb/>
pleasant savor. But all this is quite different with a South Sea<lb/>
Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after<lb/>
completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume<lb/>
fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that<lb/>
it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living<lb/>
or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no<lb/>
means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised,<lb/>
as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n495" n="458"/>
company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be<lb/>
otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such<lb/>
high health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of<lb/>
doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say, that<lb/>
the motion of a Sperm Whale&#x0027;s flukes above water dispenses a<lb/>
perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a<lb/>
warm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to<lb/>
for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be to<lb/>
that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with<lb/>
myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to<lb/>
Alexander the Great?</p>

<hi rend="sc">the castaway</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman,<lb/>
that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the<lb/>
Pequod&#x0027;s crew; an event most lamentable; and which ended in<lb/>
providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft<lb/>
with a living and ever accompanying propheey of whatever<lb/>
shattered sequel might prove her own.</p>
<p>Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the<lb/>
boats. Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose<lb/>
province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing<lb/>
the whale. As a general thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy<lb/>
fellows as the men comprising the boats&#x0027; crews. But if there<lb/>
happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in<lb/>
the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It<lb/>
was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name,<lb/>
Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;<lb/>
ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight,<lb/>
so gloomy-jolly.</p>
<pb xml:id="n496" n="459"/>
<p>In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a<lb/>
black pony and a white one, of equal developments, though of<lb/>
dissimilar color, driven in one eccentric span. But while hapless<lb/>
Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip,<lb/>
though over tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with<lb/>
that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a<lb/>
tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer,<lb/>
freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year&#x0027;s calendar<lb/>
should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth of<lb/>
Julys and New Year&#x0027;s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that<lb/>
this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;<lb/>
behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king&#x0027;s cabinets. But<lb/>
Pip loved life, and all life&#x0027;s peaceable securities; so that the<lb/>
panic-striking business in which he had somehow unaccounta-<lb/>
bly become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his brightness;<lb/>
though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily sub-<lb/>
dued in him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by<lb/>
strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him off to ten times<lb/>
the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland County in<lb/>
Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler&#x0027;s frolic on<lb/>
the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha!<lb/>
had turned the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine.<lb/>
So, though in the clear air of day, suspended against a blue-<lb/>
veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful<lb/>
glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you the<lb/>
diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a<lb/>
gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by<lb/>
some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgenees,<lb/>
infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the<lb/>
divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel<lb/>
stolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the story.</p>
<p>It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb&#x0027;s after-<lb/>
oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become<lb/>
quite maimed; and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.</p>
<pb xml:id="n497" n="460"/>
<p>The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much<lb/>
nervousness; but happily, for that time, escaped close contact<lb/>
with the whale; and therefore came off not altogether dis-<lb/>
creditably; though Stubb observing him, took care, afterwards,<lb/>
to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for<lb/>
he might often find it needful.</p>
<p>Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the<lb/>
whale; and as the fish received the darted iron, it gave its<lb/>
customary rap, which happened, in this instance, to be right<lb/>
under poor Pip&#x0027;s seat. The involuntary consternation of the<lb/>
moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat;<lb/>
and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming<lb/>
against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to<lb/>
become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water.<lb/>
That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line<lb/>
swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming<lb/>
up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by<lb/>
the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and<lb/>
neck.</p>
<p>Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the<lb/>
fire of the hunt. He hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-<lb/>
knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp edge over the line,<lb/>
and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, &#x201C;Cut?&#x201D;<lb/>
Meantime Pip&#x0027;s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God&#x0027;s<lb/>
sake! All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute, this<lb/>
entire thing happened.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Damn him, cut!&#x201D; roared Stubb; and so the whale was<lb/>
lost and Pip was saved.</p>
<p>So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was<lb/>
assailed by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly<lb/>
permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in<lb/>
a plain, business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed<lb/>
Pip officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much<lb/>
wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n498" n="461"/>
boat, Pip, except&#x2014;but all the rest was indefinite, as the<lb/>
soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, <hi rend="i">Stick to the boat</hi>, is<lb/>
your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen<lb/>
when <hi rend="i">Leap from the boat</hi>, is still better. Moreover, as if<lb/>
perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious<lb/>
advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin to<lb/>
jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and<lb/>
concluded with a peremptory command, &#x201C;Stick to the boat,<lb/>
Pip, or by the Lord, I wont pick you up if you jump; mind that.<lb/>
We can&#x0027;t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a<lb/>
whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in<lb/>
Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don&#x0027;t jump any more.&#x201D;<lb/>
Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved<lb/>
his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which propensity<lb/>
too often interferes with his benevolence.</p>
<p>But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped<lb/>
again. It was under very similar circumstances to the first<lb/>
performance; but this time he did not breast out the line; and<lb/>
hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left behind on<lb/>
the sea, like a hurried traveller&#x0027;s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but<lb/>
too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day;<lb/>
the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all<lb/>
round, to the horizon, like gold-beater&#x0027;s skin hammered out to<lb/>
the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip&#x0027;s ebon<lb/>
head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted<lb/>
when he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb&#x0027;s inexorable back was<lb/>
turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In three<lb/>
minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and<lb/>
Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his<lb/>
crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway,<lb/>
though the loftiest and the brightest.</p>
<p>Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy<lb/>
to the practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n499" n="462"/>
But the awful lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concen-<lb/>
tration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity, my<lb/>
God! who can tell it? Mark, how when sailors in a dead<lb/>
calm bathe in the open sea&#x2014;mark how closely they hug their<lb/>
ship and only coast along her sides.</p>
<p>But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his<lb/>
fate? No; he did not mean to, at least. Because there were<lb/>
two boats in his wake, and he supposed, no doubt, that they<lb/>
would of course come up to Pip very quickly, and pick him up;<lb/>
though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized<lb/>
through their own timidity, is not always manifested by the<lb/>
hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not unfre-<lb/>
quently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so<lb/>
called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to<lb/>
military navies and armies.</p>
<p>But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip,<lb/>
suddenly spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and<lb/>
gave chase; and Stubb&#x0027;s boat was now so far away, and he and<lb/>
all his crew so intent upon his fish, that Pip&#x0027;s ringed horizon<lb/>
began to expand around him miserably. By the merest chance<lb/>
the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the<lb/>
little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least, they<lb/>
said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up, but<lb/>
drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.<lb/>
Bather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange<lb/>
shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before<lb/>
his passive eyes; and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his<lb/>
hoarded heaps; and among the joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile<lb/>
eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous, God-omnipresent, coral<lb/>
insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal<lb/>
orbs. He saw God&#x0027;s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and<lb/>
spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So<lb/>
nan&#x0027;s insanity is heaven&#x0027;s sense; and wandering from all mortal<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n500" n="463"/>
reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to<lb/>
reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then<lb/>
uncompromised, indifferent as his God.</p>
<p>For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is<lb/>
common in that fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it<lb/>
will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XCIV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">a squeeze of the hand</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">That</hi> whale of Stubb&#x0027;s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought<lb/>
to the Pequod&#x0027;s side, where all those cutting and hoisting opera-<lb/>
tions previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to<lb/>
the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.</p>
<p>While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were<lb/>
employed in dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled<lb/>
with the sperm; and when the proper time arrived, this same sperm<lb/>
was carefully manipulated ere going to the try-works, of<lb/>
which anon.</p>
<p>It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when,<lb/>
with several others, I sat down before a large Constantine&#x0027;s bath<lb/>
of it, I found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there<lb/>
rolling about in the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze<lb/>
these lumps back into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No<lb/>
wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favorite cos-<lb/>
metic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener!<lb/>
such a delicious mollifier! After having my hands in it for only<lb/>
a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were,<lb/>
to serpentine and spiralize.</p>
<p>As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the<lb/>
bitter exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n501" n="464"/>
ship under indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as<lb/>
I bathed my hands among those soft, gentle globules of infil-<lb/>
trated tissues, woven almost within the hour; as they richly<lb/>
broke to my fingers, and discharged all their opulence, like<lb/>
fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that uncontami-<lb/>
nated aroma,&#x2014;literally and truly, like the smell of spring<lb/>
violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a<lb/>
musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that<lb/>
inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I<lb/>
almost began to credit the old Paracelsan superstition that<lb/>
sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger: while<lb/>
bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all ill-will, or<lb/>
petulence, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.</p>
<p>Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed<lb/>
that sperm till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that<lb/>
sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found<lb/>
myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers&#x0027; hands in it, mis-<lb/>
taking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding,<lb/>
affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget;<lb/>
that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking<lb/>
up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say,&#x2014;Oh! my<lb/>
dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish any social<lb/>
acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;<lb/>
let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves<lb/>
into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the<lb/>
very milk and sperm of kindness.</p>
<p>Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For<lb/>
now, since by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have<lb/>
perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower, or at<lb/>
least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not placing it any-<lb/>
where in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart,<lb/>
the bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side, the country; now<lb/>
that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eter-<lb/>
nally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n502" n="465"/>
of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of sper-<lb/>
maceti.</p>
<p>&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;</p>
<p>Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of<lb/>
other things akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm<lb/>
whale for the try-works.</p>
<p>First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from<lb/>
the tapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions<lb/>
of his flukes. It is tough with congealed tendons&#x2014;a wad of<lb/>
muscle&#x2014;but still contains some oil. After being severed from<lb/>
the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere<lb/>
going to the mincer. They look much like blocks of<lb/>
Berkshire marble.</p>
<p>Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmen-<lb/>
tary parts of the whale&#x0027;s flesh, here and there adhering to the<lb/>
blanket of blubber, and often participating to a considerable<lb/>
degree in its unctuousness. It is a most refreshing, convivial,<lb/>
beautiful object to behold. As its name imports, it is of an<lb/>
exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked snowy and<lb/>
golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and<lb/>
purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of<lb/>
reason, it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess,<lb/>
that once I stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted some-<lb/>
thing as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of<lb/>
Louis le Gros might have tasted, supposing him to have been<lb/>
killed the first day after the venison season, and that particular<lb/>
venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of<lb/>
the vineyards of Champagne.</p>
<p>There is another substance, and a very singular one, which<lb/>
turns up in the course of this business, but which I feel it to be<lb/>
very puzzling adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion;<lb/>
an appellation original with the whalemen, and even so is the<lb/>
nature of the substance. It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair,<lb/>
most frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n503" n="466"/>
squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to be the won-<lb/>
drously thin, ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.</p>
<p>Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whale-<lb/>
men, but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen.<lb/>
It designates the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped<lb/>
off the back of the Greenland or right whale, and much of<lb/>
which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that<lb/>
ignoble Leviathan.</p>
<p>Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A<lb/>
whaleman&#x0027;s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut<lb/>
from the tapering part of Leviathan&#x0027;s tail: it averages an inch<lb/>
in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part<lb/>
of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like<lb/>
a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic,<lb/>
allures along with it all impurities.</p>
<p>But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way<lb/>
is at once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long<lb/>
talk with its inmates. This place has previously been mentioned<lb/>
as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted<lb/>
from the whale. When the proper time arrives for cutting up<lb/>
its contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros,<lb/>
especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space<lb/>
has been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in<lb/>
pairs,&#x2014;a pike-and-gaff-man and a spade-man. The whaling-<lb/>
pike is similar to a frigate&#x0027;s boarding-weapon of the same name.<lb/>
The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the<lb/>
gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold<lb/>
it from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Mean-<lb/>
while, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly<lb/>
chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp<lb/>
as hone can make it; the spademan&#x0027;s feet are shoeless; the<lb/>
thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from<lb/>
him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n504" n="467"/>
of his assistants&#x0027;, would you be very much astonished? Toes<lb/>
are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Had</hi> you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture<lb/>
of this post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled<lb/>
forward nigh the windlass, pretty sure am I that you would<lb/>
have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange, enig-<lb/>
matical object, which you would have seen there, lying along<lb/>
lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous cistern in<lb/>
the whale&#x0027;s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower<lb/>
jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these<lb/>
would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable<lb/>
cone,&#x2014;longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter<lb/>
at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.<lb/>
And an idol, indeed, it is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness<lb/>
was. Such an idol as that found in the secret groves of Queen<lb/>
Maachah in Judea; and for worshipping which, king Asa, her<lb/>
son, did depose her, and destroyed the idol, and burnt it for an<lb/>
abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set forth in the<lb/>
15th chapter of the first book of Kings.</p>
<p>Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along,<lb/>
and assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as<lb/>
the mariners call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off<lb/>
with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from<lb/>
the field. Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now pro-<lb/>
ceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter<lb/>
the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside out, like<lb/>
a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n505" n="468"/>
double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the<lb/>
rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing<lb/>
some three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then<lb/>
cutting two slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise<lb/>
slips himself bodily into it. The mincer now stands before you<lb/>
invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all<lb/>
his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him,<lb/>
while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.</p>
<p>That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber<lb/>
for the pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious<lb/>
wooden horse, planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with<lb/>
a capacious tub beneath it, into which the minced pieces drop,<lb/>
fast as the sheets from a rapt orator&#x0027;s desk. Arrayed in decent<lb/>
black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves;<lb/>
what a candidate for an archbishoprick, what a lad for a Pope<lb/>
were this mincer!<note xml:id="fn20-468"><p>Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the<lb/>
mates to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into<lb/>
as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling<lb/>
out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased,<lb/>
besides perhaps improving it in quality.</p></note></p>

<head>CHAPTER XCVI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the try-works</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Besides</hi> her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly<lb/>
distinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious<lb/>
anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp<lb/>
in constituting the completed ship. It is as if from the open<lb/>
field a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.</p>
<p>The try-works are planted between the foremast and main-<lb/>
mast, the most roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n506" n="469"/>
are of a peculiar strength, fitted to sustain the weight of an<lb/>
almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet by eight<lb/>
square, and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate<lb/>
the deck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by<lb/>
ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it<lb/>
down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased with wood, and<lb/>
at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened hatc-<lb/>
hway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two<lb/>
in number, and each of several barrels&#x0027; capacity. When not in<lb/>
use, they are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are<lb/>
polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like<lb/>
silver punch-bowls. During the night-watches some cynical<lb/>
old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there<lb/>
for a nap. While employed in polishing them&#x2014;one man in<lb/>
each pot, side by side&#x2014;many confidential communications are<lb/>
carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound<lb/>
mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of<lb/>
the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me,<lb/>
that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that<lb/>
in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone<lb/>
for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same<lb/>
time.</p>
<p>Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the<lb/>
bare masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two<lb/>
iron mouths of the furnaces, directly underneath the pots.<lb/>
These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron. The intense<lb/>
heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the<lb/>
deck, by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the<lb/>
entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel inserted at<lb/>
the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast<lb/>
as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open<lb/>
direct from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a<lb/>
moment.</p>
<p>It was about nine o&#x0027;clock at night that the Pequod&#x0027;s try-works<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n507" n="470"/>
were first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb<lb/>
to oversee the business.</p>
<p>&#x201C;All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You<lb/>
cook, fire the works.&#x201D; This was an easy thing, for the carpen-<lb/>
ter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout<lb/>
the passage. Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first<lb/>
fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood. After<lb/>
that no wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition to<lb/>
the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the crisp,<lb/>
shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains<lb/>
considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the<lb/>
flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming<lb/>
misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and<lb/>
burns by his own body. Would that he consumed his own<lb/>
smoke! for his smoke is horrible to inhale, and inhale it you<lb/>
must, and not only that, but you must live in it for the time.<lb/>
It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may<lb/>
lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left<lb/>
wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.</p>
<p>By midnight the works were in full operation. We were<lb/>
clear from the carcase; sail had been made; the wind was<lb/>
freshening; the wild ocean darkness was intense. But that<lb/>
darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at intervals<lb/>
forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty<lb/>
rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire. The burning<lb/>
ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to some venge-<lb/>
ful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the bold<lb/>
Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with<lb/>
broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish<lb/>
frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.</p>
<p>The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded<lb/>
a wide hearth in front of them. Standing on this were the<lb/>
Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-<lb/>
ship&#x0027;s stokers. With huge pronged poles they pitched hissing<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n508" n="471"/>
masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up the fires<lb/>
beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors<lb/>
to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen<lb/>
heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the<lb/>
boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.<lb/>
Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the<lb/>
wide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-<lb/>
sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed,<lb/>
looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched<lb/>
in their heads. Their tawny features, now all begrimed with<lb/>
smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting<lb/>
barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely<lb/>
revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they<lb/>
narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of<lb/>
terror told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter<lb/>
forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the furnace;<lb/>
as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated<lb/>
with their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled<lb/>
on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and<lb/>
yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the<lb/>
blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the<lb/>
white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all<lb/>
sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and<lb/>
laden with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that<lb/>
blackness of darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her<lb/>
monomaniac commander&#x0027;s soul.</p>
<p>So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long<lb/>
hours silently guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea.<lb/>
Wrapped, for that interval, in darkness myself, I but the better<lb/>
saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of others. The<lb/>
continual sight of the fiend shapes before me, capering half in<lb/>
smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred visions in my<lb/>
soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsi-<lb/>
ness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.</p>
<pb xml:id="n509" n="472"/>
<p>But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inex-<lb/>
plicable) thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing<lb/>
sleep, I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong.<lb/>
The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned against it; in<lb/>
my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in<lb/>
the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious<lb/>
of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching<lb/>
them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see no<lb/>
compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute<lb/>
since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle<lb/>
lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet<lb/>
gloom, now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness.<lb/>
Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing<lb/>
thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead<lb/>
as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling,<lb/>
as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped<lb/>
the tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, some-<lb/>
how, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the<lb/>
matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had<lb/>
turned myself about, and was fronting the ship&#x0027;s stern, with<lb/>
my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced<lb/>
back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into<lb/>
the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and<lb/>
how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the<lb/>
night, and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!</p>
<p>Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never<lb/>
dream with thy hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the<lb/>
compass; accept the first hint of the hitching tiller; believe<lb/>
not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all things look<lb/>
ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be<lb/>
bright; those who glared like devils in the forking flames, the<lb/>
morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the glorious,<lb/>
golden, glad sun, the only true lamp&#x2014;all others but liars!</p>
<p>Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia&#x0027;s Dismal Swamp,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n510" n="473"/>
nor Rome&#x0027;s accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the<lb/>
millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon.<lb/>
The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of this<lb/>
earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore,<lb/>
that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him,<lb/>
that mortal man cannot be true&#x2014;not true, or undeveloped.<lb/>
With books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of<lb/>
Sorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon&#x0027;s, and Ecclesi-<lb/>
xsastes is the fine hammered steel of woe. &#x201C;All is vanity.&#x201D; <hi rend="sc">All</hi>.<lb/>
This wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian Solomon&#x0027;s<lb/>
wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and jails, and walks<lb/>
fast crossing grave-yards, and would rather talk of operas than<lb/>
hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of<lb/>
sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabe-<lb/>
lais as passing wise, and therefore jolly;&#x2014;not that man is fitted<lb/>
to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould<lb/>
with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.</p>
<p>But even Solomon, he says, &#x201C;the man that wandereth out<lb/>
of the way of understanding shall remain&#x201D; (<hi rend="i">i. e.</hi> even while<lb/>
living) &#x201C;in the congregation of the dead.&#x201D; Give not thyself<lb/>
up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee, deaden thee; as for the<lb/>
time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is<lb/>
a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some<lb/>
souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and<lb/>
soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.<lb/>
And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in<lb/>
the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain<lb/>
eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though<lb/>
they soar.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Had</hi> you descended from the Pequod&#x0027;s try-works to the<lb/>
Pequod&#x0027;s forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for<lb/>
one single moment you would have almost thought you were<lb/>
standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and<lb/>
counsellors. There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults,<lb/>
each mariner a chiselled muteness; a score of lamps flashing<lb/>
upon his hooded eyes.</p>
<p>In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the<lb/>
milk of queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and<lb/>
stumble in darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the<lb/>
whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he lives in light.<lb/>
He makes his berth an Aladdin&#x0027;s lamp, and lays him down in<lb/>
it; so that in the pitchiest night the ship&#x0027;s black hull still<lb/>
houses an illumination.</p>
<p>See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his hand-<lb/>
ful of lamps&#x2014;often but old bottles and vials, though&#x2014;to the<lb/>
copper cooler at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as<lb/>
mugs of ale at a vat. He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its<lb/>
unmanufactured, and, therefore, unvitiated state; a fluid un-<lb/>
known to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore. It is<lb/>
sweet as early grass butter in April. He goes and hunts for<lb/>
his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness, even<lb/>
as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Already</hi> has it been related how the great leviathan is afar<lb/>
off descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the<lb/>
watery moors, and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how<lb/>
he is then towed alongside and beheaded; and how (on the<lb/>
principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments<lb/>
in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded surtout<lb/>
becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he<lb/>
is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and<lb/>
Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through<lb/>
the fire;&#x2014;but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of<lb/>
this part of the description by rehearsing&#x2014;singing, if I may&#x2014;<lb/>
he romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks<lb/>
and striking them down into the hold, where once again levia-<lb/>
than returns to his native profundities, sliding along beneath<lb/>
the surface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.</p>
<p>While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the<lb/>
six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and<lb/>
rolling this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous<lb/>
casks are slewed round and headed over, end for end, and some-<lb/>
times perilously scoot across the slippery deck, like so many<lb/>
land slides, till at last man-handled and stayed in their course;<lb/>
and all round the hoops, rap, rap, go as many hammers as can<lb/>
play upon them, for now, <hi rend="i">ex officio</hi>, every sailor is a cooper.</p>
<p>At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then<lb/>
the great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are<lb/>
thrown open, and down go the casks to their final rest in the<lb/>
sea. This done, the hatches are replaced, and hermetically<lb/>
closed, like a closet walled up.</p>
<pb xml:id="n513" n="476"/>
<p>In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remark-<lb/>
able incidents in all the business of whaling. One day the<lb/>
planks stream with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred<lb/>
quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale&#x0027;s head are profanely<lb/>
piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke<lb/>
from the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners<lb/>
go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems<lb/>
great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is deafening.</p>
<p>But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your<lb/>
ears in this self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats<lb/>
and try-works, you would all but swear you trod some silent<lb/>
merchant vessel, with a most scrupulously neat commander.<lb/>
The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing<lb/>
virtue. This is the reason why the decks never look so white<lb/>
as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the<lb/>
ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent ley is readily<lb/>
made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the<lb/>
whale remains clinging to the side, that ley quickly exterminates<lb/>
it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets<lb/>
of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot<lb/>
is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous imple-<lb/>
ments which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed<lb/>
and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon<lb/>
the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of<lb/>
sight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the<lb/>
combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
company, the whole of this conscientious duty is at last con-<lb/>
cluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablu-<lb/>
tions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the<lb/>
immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-<lb/>
leaped from out the daintiest Holland.</p>
<p>Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and<lb/>
threes, and humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and<lb/>
fine cambrics; propose to mat the deck; think of having hangings<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n514" n="477"/>
to the top; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the<lb/>
piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such musked mariners of<lb/>
oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short of audacity. They<lb/>
know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and bring<lb/>
us napkins!</p>
<p>But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three<lb/>
men intent on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infalli-<lb/>
bly will again soil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one<lb/>
small grease-spot somewhere. Yes; and many is the time,<lb/>
when, after the severest uninterrupted labors, which know no<lb/>
night; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours; when<lb/>
from the boat, where they have swelled their wrists with all day<lb/>
rowing on the Line,&#x2014;they only step to the deck to carry vast chains,<lb/>
and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea, and in<lb/>
their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the com-<lb/>
bined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works;<lb/>
when, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves<lb/>
to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many<lb/>
is the time the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their<lb/>
clean frocks, are startled by the cry of &#x201C;There she blows!&#x201D; and<lb/>
away they fly to fight another whale, and go through the whole<lb/>
weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is man-killing!<lb/>
Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long toilings<lb/>
extracted from this world&#x0027;s vast bulk its small but valuable<lb/>
sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from<lb/>
its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of<lb/>
the soul; hardly is this done, when&#x2014;<hi rend="i">There she blows</hi>!&#x2014;the<lb/>
ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other<lb/>
world, and go through young life&#x0027;s old routine again.</p>
<p>Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright<lb/>
Greece, two thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so<lb/>
mild; I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage<lb/>
&#x2014;and, foolish as I am, taught thee, a green simple boy, how to<lb/>

<head>CHAPTER XCIX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the doubloon</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Ere</hi> now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his<lb/>
quarter-deck, taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle<lb/>
and mainmast; but in the multiplicity of other things requiring<lb/>
narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these<lb/>
walks, when most plunged in his mood, he was wont to pause<lb/>
in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely eyeing the par-<lb/>
ticular object before him. When he halted before the binnacle,<lb/>
with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass,<lb/>
that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his<lb/>
purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before<lb/>
the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon<lb/>
the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of<lb/>
nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing, if not<lb/>
hopefulness.</p>
<p>But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed<lb/>
to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions<lb/>
stamped on it, as though now for the first time beginning to<lb/>
interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever signi-<lb/>
ficance might lurk in them. And some certain significance<lb/>
lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and the round<lb/>
world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the cartload,<lb/>
as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the<lb/>
Milky Way.</p>
<p>Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked some-<lb/>
where out of the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west,<lb/>
over golden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows.<lb/>
And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n516" n="479"/>
and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and imma-<lb/>
culate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor,<lb/>
though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed<lb/>
by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded<lb/>
with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach,<lb/>
nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset<lb/>
left it last. For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-<lb/>
striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and<lb/>
all, the mariners revered it as the white whale&#x0027;s talisman.<lb/>
Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,<lb/>
wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would<lb/>
ever live to spend it.</p>
<p>Now those noble golden coins of South America are as<lb/>
medals of the sun and tropic token-pieces. Here palms,<lb/>
alpacas, and volcanoes; sun&#x0027;s disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-<lb/>
of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant profusion<lb/>
stamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an<lb/>
added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing through<lb/>
those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.</p>
<p>It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most<lb/>
wealthy example of these things. On its round border it bore<lb/>
the letters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So<lb/>
this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of<lb/>
the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;<lb/>
and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning<lb/>
clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw<lb/>
the likeness of three Andes&#x0027; summits; from one a flame; a tower<lb/>
on another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over<lb/>
all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked<lb/>
with their usual cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the<lb/>
equinoctial point at Libra.</p>
<p>Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others,<lb/>
was now pausing.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x0027;s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n517" n="480"/>
towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look here,&#x2014;three<lb/>
peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the<lb/>
volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted, and<lb/>
victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this<lb/>
round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like<lb/>
a magician&#x0027;s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors<lb/>
back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for<lb/>
those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself.<lb/>
Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see!<lb/>
aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six<lb/>
months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries!<lb/>
From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, &#x0027;t is fit<lb/>
that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be it, then!<lb/>
Here&#x0027;s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil&#x0027;s claws<lb/>
must have left their mouldings there since yesterday,&#x201D; murmured<lb/>
Starbuck to himself, leaning against the bulwarks. &#x201C;The old<lb/>
man seems to read Belshazzar&#x0027;s awful writing. I have never<lb/>
marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read.<lb/>
A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that<lb/>
almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in<lb/>
this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom,<lb/>
the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If<lb/>
we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;<lb/>
but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way,<lb/>
to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at mid-<lb/>
night, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we<lb/>
gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly,<lb/>
but still sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me<lb/>
falsely.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There now&#x0027;s the old Mogul,&#x201D; soliloquized Stubb by the try-<lb/>
works, &#x201C;he&#x0027;s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the<lb/>
same, and both with faces which I should say might be some-<lb/>
where within nine fathoms long. And all from looking at a piece<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n518" n="481"/>
of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer&#x0027;s<lb/>
Hook, I&#x0027;dnot look at it very long ere spending it. Humph! in my<lb/>
poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen<lb/>
doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old<lb/>
Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your<lb/>
doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty<lb/>
of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quar-<lb/>
ter joes. What then should there be in this doubloon of the<lb/>
Equator that is so killing wonderful? By Golconda! let me<lb/>
read it once. Halloa! here&#x0027;s signs and wonders truly! That,<lb/>
now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and<lb/>
what my almanack below calls ditto. I&#x0027;ll get the almanack<lb/>
and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll&#x0027;s arith-<lb/>
metic, I&#x0027;ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer<lb/>
curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here&#x0027;s the<lb/>
book. Let&#x0027;s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he&#x0027;s<lb/>
always among &#x0027;em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are&#x2014;here<lb/>
they go&#x2014;all alive:&#x2014;Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull<lb/>
and Jimimi! here&#x0027;s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the<lb/>
sun he wheels among &#x0027;em. Aye, here on the coin he&#x0027;s just<lb/>
crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms all<lb/>
in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must<lb/>
know your places. You&#x0027;ll do to give us the bare words and<lb/>
facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That&#x0027;s my small<lb/>
experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch&#x0027;s<lb/>
navigator, and Daboll&#x0027;s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders,<lb/>
eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant<lb/>
in wonders! There&#x0027;s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist&#x2014;<lb/>
hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac<lb/>
here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I&#x0027;ll read<lb/>
it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin:<lb/>
there&#x0027;s Aries, or the Ram&#x2014;lecherous dog, he begets us; then,<lb/>
Taurus, or the Bull&#x2014;he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,<lb/>
or the Twins&#x2014;that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Vir-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n519" n="482"/>
tue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and<lb/>
here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path&#x2014;<lb/>
he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we<lb/>
escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that&#x0027;s our first love; we<lb/>
marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or<lb/>
the Scales&#x2014;happiness weighed and found wanting; and while<lb/>
we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as<lb/>
Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in rear; we are curing the<lb/>
wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or<lb/>
the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts,<lb/>
stand aside! here&#x0027;s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the<lb/>
Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed;<lb/>
when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge<lb/>
and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we<lb/>
sleep. There&#x0027;s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun<lb/>
goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive<lb/>
and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and<lb/>
trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly&#x0027;s the<lb/>
word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes little<lb/>
King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let&#x0027;s hear<lb/>
what he&#x0027;ll have to say. There; he&#x0027;s before it; he&#x0027;ll out with<lb/>
something presently. So, so; he&#x0027;s beginning.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and<lb/>
whoever raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him.<lb/>
So, what&#x0027;s all this staring been about? It is worth sixteen<lb/>
dollars, that&#x0027;s true; and at two cents the cigar, that&#x0027;s nine hun-<lb/>
dred and sixty cigars. I wont smoke dirty pipes like Stubb,<lb/>
but I like cigars, and here&#x0027;s nine hundred and sixty of them;<lb/>
so here goes Flask aloft to spy &#x0027;em out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it<lb/>
has a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a<lb/>
sort of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old<lb/>
Manxman&#x2014;the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is,<lb/>
before he took to the sea. He luffs up before the doubloon;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n520" n="483"/>
halloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast; why,<lb/>
there&#x0027;s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he&#x0027;s back<lb/>
again; what does that mean? Hark! he&#x0027;s muttering&#x2014;voice<lb/>
like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and<lb/>
a day, when the sun stands in some one of these signs. I&#x0027;ve<lb/>
studied signs, and know their marks; they were taught me two<lb/>
score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen. Now, in<lb/>
what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there<lb/>
it is, right opposite the gold. And what&#x0027;s the horse-shoe sign?<lb/>
The lion is the horse-shoe sign&#x2014;the roaring and devouring<lb/>
lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x0027;s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts<lb/>
of men in one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here<lb/>
comes Queequeg&#x2014;all tattooing&#x2014;looks like the signs of the<lb/>
Zodiac himself. What says the Cannibal? As I live he&#x0027;s com-<lb/>
paring notes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in<lb/>
the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as the old<lb/>
women talk Surgeon&#x0027;s Astronomy in the back country. And by<lb/>
Jove, he&#x0027;s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh&#x2014;I<lb/>
guess it&#x0027;s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don&#x0027;t know what<lb/>
to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some<lb/>
king&#x0027;s trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,<lb/>
Fedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of<lb/>
his pumps as usual. What does he say, with that look of<lb/>
his? Ah, only makes a sign to the sign and bows himself;<lb/>
there is a sun on the coin&#x2014;fire worshipper, depend upon it.<lb/>
Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip&#x2014;poor boy! would<lb/>
he had died, or I; he&#x0027;s half horrible to me. He too has been<lb/>
watching all of these interpreters&#x2014;myself included&#x2014;and look<lb/>
now, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand<lb/>
away again and hear him. Hark!</p>
<p>&#x201C;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Upon my soul, he&#x0027;s been studying Murray&#x0027;s Grammar!</p>
<pb xml:id="n521" n="484"/>
<p>Improving his mind, poor fellow! But what&#x0027;s that he says<lb/>
now&#x2014;hist!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, he&#x0027;s getting it by heart&#x2014;hist! again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, that&#x0027;s funny.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and<lb/>
I&#x0027;m a crow, especially when I stand a&#x0027;top of this pine tree here.<lb/>
Caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! caw! Ain&#x0027;t I a crow? And<lb/>
where&#x0027;s the scare-crow? There he stands; two bones stuck<lb/>
into a pair of old trowsers, and two more poked into the sleeves<lb/>
of an old jacket.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wonder if he means me?&#x2014;complimentary!&#x2014;poor lad!&#x2014;<lb/>
I could go hang myself. Any way, for the present, I&#x0027;ll quit<lb/>
Pip&#x0027;s vicinity. I can stand the rest, for they have plain wits;<lb/>
but he&#x0027;s too crazy-witty for my sanity. So, so, I leave him<lb/>
muttering.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Here&#x0027;s the ship&#x0027;s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all<lb/>
on fire to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what&#x0027;s the<lb/>
consequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for<lb/>
when aught&#x0027;s nailed to the mast it&#x0027;s a sign that things grow<lb/>
desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he&#x0027;ll nail ye!<lb/>
This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland county, cut down<lb/>
a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some<lb/>
old darkey&#x0027;s wedding ring. How did it get there? And so<lb/>
they&#x0027;ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this<lb/>
old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters<lb/>
for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious<lb/>
gold!&#x2014;the green miser &#x0027;ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God<lb/>
goes &#x0027;mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and<lb/>
cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and<lb/>
get your hoe-cake done!&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="sc">Ship</hi>, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?&#x201D;</p>
<p>So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English<lb/>
colors, bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the<lb/>
old man was standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg<lb/>
plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who was carelessly<lb/>
reclining in his own boat&#x0027;s bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly,<lb/>
good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed<lb/>
in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of<lb/>
blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed<lb/>
behind him like the broidered arm of a huzzar&#x0027;s surcoat.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hast seen the White Whale?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;See you this?&#x201D; and withdrawing it from the folds that had<lb/>
hidden it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, termi-<lb/>
nating in a wooden head like a mallet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Man my boat!&#x201D; cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about<lb/>
the oars near him&#x2014;&#x201C;Stand by to lower!&#x201D;</p>
<p>In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and<lb/>
his crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside<lb/>
of the stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself.<lb/>
In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since<lb/>
the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any<lb/>
vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an inge-<lb/>
nious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the<lb/>
Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n523" n="486"/>
vessel at a moment&#x0027;s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter<lb/>
for anybody&#x2014;except those who are almost hourly used to it,<lb/>
like whalemen&#x2014;to clamber up a ship&#x0027;s side from a boat on the<lb/>
open sea; for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards<lb/>
the bulwarks, and then instantaneously drop it half way down<lb/>
to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg, and the strange ship<lb/>
of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention,<lb/>
Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman<lb/>
again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he<lb/>
could hardly hope to attain.</p>
<p>It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward<lb/>
circumstance that befel him, and which indirectly sprang from<lb/>
his luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated<lb/>
Ahab. And in the present instance, all this was heightened<lb/>
by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning over<lb/>
the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and<lb/>
swinging towards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-<lb/>
ropes; for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a<lb/>
one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea<lb/>
bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, be-<lb/>
cause the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs<lb/>
stood, cried out, &#x201C;I see, I see!&#x2014;avast heaving there! Jump,<lb/>
boys, and swing over the cutting-tackle.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside<lb/>
a day or two previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and<lb/>
the massive curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still<lb/>
attached to the end. This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who<lb/>
at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary thigh into the<lb/>
curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor,<lb/>
or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held<lb/>
himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own<lb/>
weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running<lb/>
parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the<lb/>
high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n524" n="487"/>
With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other<lb/>
captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and<lb/>
crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in<lb/>
his walrus way, &#x201C;Aye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!<lb/>
&#x2014;an arm and a leg!&#x2014;an arm that never can shrink, d&#x0027;ye see;<lb/>
and a leg that never can run. Where did&#x0027;st thou see the<lb/>
White Whale?&#x2014;how long ago?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The White Whale,&#x201D; said the Englishman, pointing his<lb/>
ivory arm towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it,<lb/>
as if it had been a telescope; &#x201C;There I saw him, on the Line,<lb/>
last season.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And he took that arm off, did he?&#x201D; asked Ahab, now slid-<lb/>
ing down from the capstan, and resting on the Englishman&#x0027;s<lb/>
shoulder, as he did so.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Spin me the yarn,&#x201D; said Ahab; &#x201C;how was it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the<lb/>
Line,&#x201D; began the Englishman. &#x201C;I was ignorant of the White<lb/>
Whale at that time. Well, one day we lowered for a pod of<lb/>
four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them; a<lb/>
regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling<lb/>
round so, that my boat&#x0027;s crew could only trim dish, by sitting<lb/>
all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches<lb/>
from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a<lb/>
milky-white head and hump, all crows&#x0027; feet and wrinkles.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was he, it was he!&#x201D; cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his<lb/>
suspended breath.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye&#x2014;they were mine&#x2014;<hi rend="i">my</hi> irons,&#x201D;cried Ahab, exult-<lb/>
ingly&#x2014;&#x201C;but on!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Give me a chance, then,&#x201D; said the Englishman, good-<lb/>
humoredly. &#x201C;Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white<lb/>
head and hump, runs all afoam into the pod, and goes to<lb/>
snapping furiously at my fast-line.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n525" n="488"/>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, I see!&#x2014;wanted to part it; free the fast-fish&#x2014;an old<lb/>
trick&#x2014;I know him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;How it was exactly,&#x201D; continued the one-armed commander,<lb/>
&#x201C;I do not know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth,<lb/>
caught there somehow; but we didn&#x0027;t know it then; so that<lb/>
when we afterwards pulled on the line, bounce we came<lb/>
plump on to his hump! instead of the other whale&#x0027;s that went<lb/>
off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and<lb/>
what a noble great whale it was&#x2014;the noblest and biggest I<lb/>
ever saw, sir, in my life&#x2014;I resolved to capture him, spite of the<lb/>
boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard<lb/>
line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw<lb/>
(for I have a devil of a boat&#x0027;s crew for a pull on a whale-line);<lb/>
seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate&#x0027;s boat&#x2014;Mr.<lb/>
Mounttop&#x0027;s here (by the way, Captain&#x2014;Mounttop; Mounttop<lb/>
&#x2014;the captain);&#x2014;as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop&#x0027;s<lb/>
boat, which, d&#x0027;ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine,<lb/>
then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grand-<lb/>
father have it. But, Lord, look you, sir&#x2014;hearts and souls alive,<lb/>
man&#x2014;the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat&#x2014;both<lb/>
eyes out&#x2014;all befogged and bedeadened with black foam&#x2014;the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the<lb/>
air, like a marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I<lb/>
was groping at midday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels;<lb/>
as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it over-<lb/>
board&#x2014;down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat<lb/>
in two, leaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white<lb/>
hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips.<lb/>
We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized<lb/>
hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment<lb/>
clung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me<lb/>
off, and at the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart for-<lb/>
wards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed<lb/>
second iron towing along near me caught me here&#x201D; (clapping<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n526" n="489"/>
his hand just below his shoulder); &#x201C;yes, caught me just here,<lb/>
I say, and bore me down to Hell&#x0027;s flames, I was thinking; when,<lb/>
when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript its<lb/>
way along the flesh&#x2014;clear along the whole length of my arm<lb/>
&#x2014;came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;&#x2014;and that gentle-<lb/>
man there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain&#x2014;Dr.<lb/>
Bunger, ship&#x0027;s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,&#x2014;the captain). Now,<lb/>
Bunger boy, spin your part of the yarn.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had<lb/>
been all the time standing near them, with nothing specific<lb/>
visible, to denote his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was<lb/>
an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed in a faded<lb/>
blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus<lb/>
far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held<lb/>
in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other, occasionally cast-<lb/>
ing a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled<lb/>
captains. But, at his superior&#x0027;s introduction of him to Ahab,<lb/>
he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain&#x0027;s<lb/>
bidding.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was a shocking bad wound,&#x201D; began the whale-surgeon;<lb/>
&#x201C;and, taking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old<lb/>
Sammy&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,&#x201D; interrupted the<lb/>
one-armed captain, addressing Ahab; &#x201C;go on, boy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of<lb/>
the blazing hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use<lb/>
&#x2014;I did all I could; sat up with him nights; was very severe<lb/>
with him in the matter of diet&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, very severe!&#x201D; chimed in the patient himself; then<lb/>
suddenly altering his voice, &#x201C;Drinking hot rum toddies with me<lb/>
every night, till he couldn&#x0027;t see to put on the bandages; and<lb/>
sending me to bed, half seas over, about three o&#x0027;clock in the<lb/>
morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and was<lb/>
very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dieteti-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n527" n="490"/>
cally severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh out!<lb/>
why don&#x0027;t ye? You know you&#x0027;re a precious jolly rascal.) But,<lb/>
heave ahead, boy, I&#x0027;d rather be killed by you than kept alive<lb/>
by any other man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected<lb/>
sir&#x201D;&#x2014;said the imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bow-<lb/>
ing to Ahab&#x2014;&#x201C;is apt to be facetious at times; he spins us<lb/>
many clever things of that sort. But I may as well say&#x2014;en<lb/>
passant, as the French remark&#x2014;that I myself&#x2014;that is to say,<lb/>
Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy&#x2014;am a strict total<lb/>
abstinence man; I never drink&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Water!&#x201D; cried the captain; &#x201C;he never drinks it; it&#x0027;s a sort<lb/>
of fits to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia;<lb/>
but go on&#x2014;go on with the arm story.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes, I may as well,&#x201D; said the surgeon, coolly. &#x201C;I was about<lb/>
observing, sir, before Captain Boomer&#x0027;s facetious interruption,<lb/>
that spite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept<lb/>
getting worse and worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly<lb/>
gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more than two feet and<lb/>
several inches long. I measured it with the lead line. In short,<lb/>
it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it came.<lb/>
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that<lb/>
thing is against all rule&#x201D;&#x2014;pointing at it with the marlingspike<lb/>
&#x2014;&#x201C;that is the captain&#x0027;s work, not mine; he ordered the car-<lb/>
penter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the<lb/>
end, to knock some one&#x0027;s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried<lb/>
mine once. He flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do<lb/>
ye see this dent, sir&#x201D;&#x2014;removing his hat, and brushing aside his<lb/>
hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which<lb/>
bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having<lb/>
been a wound&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, the captain there will tell you how that<lb/>
came here; he knows.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, I don&#x0027;t,&#x201D; said the captain, &#x201C;but his mother did; he<lb/>
was born with it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you&#x2014;you Bunger!<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n528" n="491"/>
was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world?<lb/>
Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in pickle, you dog;<lb/>
you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What became of the White Whale?&#x201D; now cried Ahab, who<lb/>
thus far had been impatiently listening to this bye-play between<lb/>
the two Englishmen.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh!&#x201D; cried the one-armed captain, &#x201C;Oh, yes! Well; after<lb/>
he sounded, we didn&#x0027;t see him again for some time; in fact, as<lb/>
I before hinted, I didn&#x0027;t then know what whale it was that had<lb/>
served me such a trick, till some time afterwards, when coming<lb/>
back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick&#x2014;as some call<lb/>
him&#x2014;and then I knew it was he.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Did&#x0027;st thou cross his wake again?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Twice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But could not fasten?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Didn&#x0027;t want to try to: ain&#x0027;t one limb enough? What<lb/>
should I do without this other arm? And I&#x0027;m thinking Moby<lb/>
Dick doesn&#x0027;t bite so much as he swallows.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, then,&#x201D; interrupted Bunger, &#x201C;give him your left arm<lb/>
for bait to get the right. Do you know, gentlemen&#x201D;&#x2014;very<lb/>
gravely and mathematically bowing to each Captain in succes-<lb/>
sion&#x2014;&#x201C;Do you know, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of<lb/>
the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence,<lb/>
that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even<lb/>
a man&#x0027;s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take<lb/>
for the White Whale&#x0027;s malice is only his awkwardness. For he<lb/>
never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify<lb/>
by feints. But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow,<lb/>
formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swal-<lb/>
low jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good<lb/>
earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I<lb/>
gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d&#x0027;ye<lb/>
see. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and<lb/>
fully incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Cap-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n529" n="492"/>
tain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind<lb/>
to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent<lb/>
burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let<lb/>
the whale have another chance at you shortly, that&#x0027;s all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, thank ye, Bunger,&#x201D; said the English Captain, &#x201C;he&#x0027;s<lb/>
welcome to the arm he has, since I can&#x0027;t help it, and didn&#x0027;t<lb/>
know him then; but not to another one. No more White<lb/>
Whales for me; I&#x0027;ve lowered for him once, and that has satis-<lb/>
fied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know<lb/>
that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but,<lb/>
hark ye, he&#x0027;s best let alone; don&#x0027;t you think so, Captain?&#x201D;&#x2014;<lb/>
glancing at the ivory leg.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is<lb/>
best let alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures.<lb/>
He&#x0027;s all a magnet! How long since thou saw&#x0027;st him last?<lb/>
Which way heading?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend&#x0027;s,&#x201D; cried Bunger,<lb/>
stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely<lb/>
snuffing; &#x201C;this man&#x0027;s blood&#x2014;bring the thermometer!&#x2014;it&#x0027;s at<lb/>
the boiling point!&#x2014;his pulse makes these planks beat!&#x2014;sir!&#x201D;&#x2014;<lb/>
taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
arm.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Avast!&#x201D; roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;Man the boat! Which way heading?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good God!&#x201D; cried the English Captain, to whom the ques-<lb/>
tion was put. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s the matter? He was heading east, I<lb/>
think.&#x2014;Is your Captain crazy?&#x201D; whispering Fedallah.</p>
<p>But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bul-<lb/>
warks to take the boat&#x0027;s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the<lb/>
cutting-tackle towards him, commanded the ship&#x0027;s sailors to<lb/>
stand by to lower.</p>
<p>In a moment he was standing in the boat&#x0027;s stern, and the<lb/>
Manilla men were springing to their oars. In vain the English<lb/>
Captain hailed him. With back to the stranger ship, and face<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n530" n="493"/>
set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of<lb/>
the Pequod.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the decanter</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Ere</hi> the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here,<lb/>
that she hailed from London, and was named after the late<lb/>
Samuel Enderby, merchant of that city, the original of the<lb/>
famous whaling house of Enderby &#x0026; Sons; a house which in<lb/>
my poor whaleman&#x0027;s opinion, comes not far behind the united<lb/>
royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real his-<lb/>
torical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775,<lb/>
this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-<lb/>
documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted<lb/>
out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm<lb/>
Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726)<lb/>
our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard<lb/>
had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North<lb/>
and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded<lb/>
here, that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to<lb/>
harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that<lb/>
for half a century they were the only people of the whole<lb/>
globe who so harpooned him.</p>
<p>In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express<lb/>
purpose, and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys,<lb/>
boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the first among the nations<lb/>
to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South Sea. The<lb/>
voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth<lb/>
with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia&#x0027;s example<lb/>
was soon followed by other ships, English and American,<lb/>
and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n531" n="494"/>
thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the inde-<lb/>
fatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons&#x2014;<lb/>
how many, their mother only knows&#x2014;and under their imme-<lb/>
diate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British<lb/>
government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a<lb/>
whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded<lb/>
by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of<lb/>
it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this<lb/>
is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery<lb/>
whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote<lb/>
waters of Japan. That ship&#x2014;well called the &#x201C;Syren&#x201D;&#x2014;made<lb/>
a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great<lb/>
Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known. The<lb/>
Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain<lb/>
Coffin, a Nantucketer.</p>
<p>All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think,<lb/>
exists to the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel<lb/>
must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea<lb/>
of the other world.</p>
<p>The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a<lb/>
very fast sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once<lb/>
at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank<lb/>
good flip down in the forecastle. It was a fine gam we had,<lb/>
and they were all trumps&#x2014;every soul on board. A short life<lb/>
to them, and a jolly death. And that fine gam I had&#x2014;long,<lb/>
very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory<lb/>
heel&#x2014;it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that<lb/>
ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember<lb/>
me, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip?<lb/>
Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and<lb/>
when the squall came (for it&#x0027;s squally off there by Patagonia),<lb/>
and all hands&#x2014;visitors and all&#x2014;were called to reef topsails, we<lb/>
were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in<lb/>
bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n532" n="495"/>
the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a<lb/>
warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts did<lb/>
not go overboard; and by and bye we scrambled down, so<lb/>
sober, that we had to pass the flip again, though the savage<lb/>
salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much<lb/>
diluted and pickled it to my taste.</p>
<p>The beef was fine&#x2014;tough, but with body in it. They said<lb/>
it was bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but<lb/>
I do not know, for certain, how that was. They had dumplings<lb/>
too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular, and inde-<lb/>
structible dumplings. I fancied that you could feel them,<lb/>
and roll them about in you after they were swallowed. If you<lb/>
stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of<lb/>
you like billiard-balls. The bread&#x2014;but that couldn&#x0027;t be helped;<lb/>
besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained<lb/>
the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very<lb/>
light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner<lb/>
when you ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm,<lb/>
considering the dimensions of the cook&#x0027;s boilers, including his<lb/>
own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel<lb/>
Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip<lb/>
and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to<lb/>
hat-band.</p>
<p>But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and<lb/>
some other English whalers I know of&#x2014;not all though&#x2014;were<lb/>
such famous, hospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and<lb/>
the bread, and the can, and the joke; and were not soon weary<lb/>
of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you. The<lb/>
abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for<lb/>
historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical<lb/>
whale research, when it has seemed needed.</p>
<p>The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hol-<lb/>
landers, Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many<lb/>
terms still extant in the fishery; and what is yet more, their<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n533" n="496"/>
fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and drink. For, as a<lb/>
general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but<lb/>
not so the English whaler. Hence, in the English, this thing<lb/>
of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural, but incidental<lb/>
and particular; and, therefore, must have some special origin,<lb/>
which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.</p>
<p>During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled<lb/>
upon an ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling<lb/>
smell of it, I knew must be about whalers. The title was,<lb/>
&#x201C;Dan Coopman,&#x201D; wherefore I concluded that this must be the<lb/>
invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery,<lb/>
as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in<lb/>
this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one &#x201C;Fitz<lb/>
Swackhammer.&#x201D; But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned<lb/>
man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college<lb/>
of Santa Claus and St. Pott&#x0027;s, to whom I handed the work for<lb/>
translation, giving him a box of sperm candles for his trouble&#x2014;<lb/>
this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he spied the book, assured<lb/>
me that &#x201C;Dan Coopman&#x201D; did not mean &#x201C;The Cooper,&#x201D; but<lb/>
&#x201C;The Merchant.&#x201D; In short, this ancient and learned Low<lb/>
Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among<lb/>
other subjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale<lb/>
fishery. And in this chapter it was, headed &#x201C;Smeer,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Fat,&#x201D;<lb/>
that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders<lb/>
and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as<lb/>
translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:</p>
<quote>
<p>400,000 lbs. of beef.</p>
<p>60,000 lbs. Friesland pork.</p>
<p>150,000 lbs. of stock fish.</p>
<p>550,000 lbs. of biscuit.</p>
<p>72,000 lbs. of soft bread.</p>
<p>2,800 firkins of butter.</p>
<p>20,000 lbs. Texel &#x0026; Leyden cheese.</p>
<p>144,000 lbs. cheese (probably an inferior article).</p>
<pb xml:id="n534" n="497"/>
<p>550 ankers of Geneva.</p>
<p>10,800 barrels of beer.</p>
</quote>
<p>Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not<lb/>
so in the present case, however, where the reader is flooded<lb/>
with whole pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and<lb/>
good cheer.</p>
<p>At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting<lb/>
of all this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound<lb/>
thoughts were incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcen-<lb/>
dental and Platonic application; and, furthermore, I compiled<lb/>
supplementary tables of my own, touching the probable quan-<lb/>
tity of stock-fish, &#x0026;c., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer<lb/>
in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery. In<lb/>
the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and Leyden<lb/>
cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their<lb/>
naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous<lb/>
by the nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing<lb/>
their game in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of<lb/>
that Esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge<lb/>
each other in bumpers of train oil.</p>
<p>The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now,<lb/>
as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short<lb/>
summer of that climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these<lb/>
Dutch whalemen, including the short voyage to and from the<lb/>
Spitzbergen sea, did not much exceed three months, say, and<lb/>
reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail, we have<lb/>
5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have pre-<lb/>
cisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks&#x0027; allowance,<lb/>
exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin. Now,<lb/>
whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one<lb/>
might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to<lb/>
stand up in a boat&#x0027;s head, and take good aim at flying whales;<lb/>
this would seem somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at<lb/>
them, and hit them too. But this was very far North, be it<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n535" n="498"/>
remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution;<lb/>
upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to<lb/>
make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his<lb/>
boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New<lb/>
Bedford.</p>
<p>But no more; enough has been said to show that the old<lb/>
Dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers;<lb/>
and that the English whalers have not neglected so excellent an<lb/>
example. For, say they, when cruising in an empty ship, if<lb/>
you can get nothing better out of the world, get a good dinner<lb/>
out of it, at least. And this empties the decanter.</p>

<hi rend="sc">a bower in the arsacides</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Hitherto</hi>, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I<lb/>
have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or<lb/>
separately and in detail upon some few interior structural<lb/>
features. But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension<lb/>
of him, it behoves me now to unbutton him still further, and<lb/>
untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and<lb/>
casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his inner-<lb/>
most bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to<lb/>
say, in his unconditional skeleton.</p>
<p>But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oars-<lb/>
man in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subter-<lb/>
ranean parts of the whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon<lb/>
your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea;<lb/>
and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibi-<lb/>
tion? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown<lb/>
whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-<lb/>
pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n536" n="499"/>
Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah<lb/>
alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams;<lb/>
the rafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up<lb/>
the frame-work of leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-<lb/>
rooms, butteries, and cheeseries in his bowels.</p>
<p>I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated<lb/>
very far beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I<lb/>
have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in minia-<lb/>
ture. In a ship I belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale was<lb/>
once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag, to make<lb/>
sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the<lb/>
lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my<lb/>
boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading<lb/>
all the contents of that young cub?</p>
<p>And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan<lb/>
in their gigantic, full grown development, for that rare know-<lb/>
ledge I am indebted to my late royal friend Tranquo, king<lb/>
of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For being at Tranque, years<lb/>
ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was<lb/>
invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord<lb/>
of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen<lb/>
not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town,<lb/>
his capital.</p>
<p>Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo,<lb/>
being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vert&#x00F9;,<lb/>
had brought together in Pupella whatever rare things the more<lb/>
ingenious of his people could invent; chiefly carved woods of<lb/>
wonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles,<lb/>
aromatic canoes; and all these distributed among whatever<lb/>
natural wonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves<lb/>
had cast upon his shores.</p>
<p>Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which,<lb/>
after an unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and<lb/>
stranded, with his head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n537" n="500"/>
like, tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet. When the vast<lb/>
body had at last been stripped of its fathom-deep enfoldings,<lb/>
and the bones become dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton<lb/>
was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a grand<lb/>
temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.</p>
<p>The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebr&#x00E6; were carved<lb/>
with Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull,<lb/>
the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that<lb/>
the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout; while, sus-<lb/>
pended from a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the<lb/>
devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.</p>
<p>It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of<lb/>
the Icy Glen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their<lb/>
living sap; the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver&#x0027;s<lb/>
loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine<lb/>
tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the<lb/>
figures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the<lb/>
shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all<lb/>
these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the leaves,<lb/>
the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied ver-<lb/>
dure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!&#x2014;pause!&#x2014;one word!&#x2014;<lb/>
whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore<lb/>
all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!&#x2014;stay thy hand!<lb/>
&#x2014;but one single word with thee! Nay&#x2014;the shuttle flies&#x2014;the<lb/>
figures float from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for<lb/>
ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that<lb/>
weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by<lb/>
that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;<lb/>
and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices<lb/>
that speak through it. For even so it is in all material facto-<lb/>
ries. The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying<lb/>
spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the walls,<lb/>
bursting from the opened casements. Thereby have villanies<lb/>
been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for so, in all<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n538" n="501"/>
this din of the great world&#x0027;s loom, thy subtlest thinkings may<lb/>
be overheard afar.</p>
<p>Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean<lb/>
wood, the great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging&#x2014;a<lb/>
gigantic idler! Yet, as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof<lb/>
intermixed and hummed around him, the mighty idler seemed<lb/>
the cunning weaver; himself all woven over with the vines;<lb/>
every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself a<lb/>
skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim god<lb/>
wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.</p>
<p>Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous<lb/>
whale, and saw the skull an altar, and the artificial smoke<lb/>
ascending from where the real jet had issued, I marvelled that<lb/>
the king should regard a chapel as an object of vert&#x00F9;. He<lb/>
laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear<lb/>
that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced before<lb/>
this skeleton&#x2014;brushed the vines aside&#x2014;broke through the ribs<lb/>
&#x2014;and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long<lb/>
amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbors. But<lb/>
soon my line was out; and following it back, I emerged from<lb/>
the opening where I entered. I saw no living thing within;<lb/>
naught was there but bones.</p>
<p>Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived<lb/>
within the skeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the<lb/>
priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib. &#x201C;How<lb/>
now!&#x201D; they shouted; &#x201C;Dar&#x0027;st thou measure this our god!.<lb/>
That&#x0027;s for us.&#x201D; &#x201C;Aye, priests&#x2014;well, how long do ye<lb/>
make him, then?&#x201D; But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,<lb/>
concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other&#x0027;s sconces<lb/>
with their yard-sticks&#x2014;the great skull echoed&#x2014;and seizing that<lb/>
lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.</p>
<p>These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But<lb/>
first, be it recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter<lb/>
any fancied measurement I please. Because there are skeleton<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n539" n="502"/>
authorities you can refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a<lb/>
Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in Hull, England, one of<lb/>
the whaling ports of that country, where they have some fine speci-<lb/>
mens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard<lb/>
that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they<lb/>
have what the proprietors call &#x201C;the only perfect specimen of a<lb/>
Greenland or River Whale in the United States.&#x201D; Moreover,<lb/>
at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a<lb/>
certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton<lb/>
of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size, by no means of the full-<lb/>
grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo&#x0027;s.</p>
<p>In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skele-<lb/>
tons belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon<lb/>
similar grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted<lb/>
it; and Sir Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of<lb/>
those parts. Sir Clifford&#x0027;s whale has been articulated through-<lb/>
out; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and<lb/>
shut him, in all his bony cavities&#x2014;spread out his ribs like a<lb/>
gigantic fan&#x2014;and swing all day upon his lower jaw. Locks<lb/>
are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a<lb/>
footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at<lb/>
his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at<lb/>
the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear<lb/>
the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the<lb/>
unrivalled view from his forehead.</p>
<p>The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are<lb/>
copied verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed;<lb/>
as in my wild wanderings at that period, there was no other<lb/>
secure way of preserving such valuable statistics. But as I was<lb/>
crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to<lb/>
remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing&#x2014;at<lb/>
least, what untattooed parts might remain&#x2014;I did not trouble<lb/>
myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all<lb/>
enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.</p>

<hi rend="sc">measurement of the whale&#x0027;s skeleton</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">In</hi> the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain<lb/>
statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose<lb/>
skeleton we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove<lb/>
useful here.</p>
<p>According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I<lb/>
partly base upon Captain Scoresby&#x0027;s estimate, of seventy tons<lb/>
for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length;<lb/>
according to my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of<lb/>
the largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in<lb/>
length, and something less than forty feet in its fullest circum-<lb/>
ference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that,<lb/>
reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably out-<lb/>
weigh the combined population of a whole village of one thou-<lb/>
sand one hundred inhabitants.</p>
<p>Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be<lb/>
put to this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any lands-<lb/>
man&#x0027;s imagination!</p>
<p>Having already in various ways put before you his skull,<lb/>
spout-hole, jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts,<lb/>
I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the<lb/>
general bulk of his unobstructed bones. But as the colossal<lb/>
skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent<lb/>
of the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated part; and<lb/>
as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you<lb/>
must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as<lb/>
we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of<lb/>
the general structure we are about to view.</p>
<pb xml:id="n541" n="504"/>
<p>In length, the Sperm Whale&#x0027;s skeleton at Tranque measured<lb/>
seventy-two feet; so that when fully invested and extended in<lb/>
life, he must have been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the<lb/>
skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living<lb/>
body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull and jaw comprised<lb/>
some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain back-bone.<lb/>
Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a third of<lb/>
its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once<lb/>
enclosed his vitals.</p>
<p>To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved<lb/>
spine, extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little<lb/>
resembled the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks,<lb/>
when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted,<lb/>
and the keel is otherwise, for the time, but a long, disconnected<lb/>
timber.</p>
<p>The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the<lb/>
neck, was nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth<lb/>
were each successively longer, till you came to the climax of the<lb/>
fifth, or one of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and<lb/>
some inches. From that part, the remaining ribs diminished,<lb/>
till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches.<lb/>
In general thickness, they all bore a seemly correspondence to<lb/>
their length. The middle ribs were the most arched. In some<lb/>
of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay foot-<lb/>
path bridges over small streams.</p>
<p>In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with<lb/>
the circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the<lb/>
skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested<lb/>
form. The largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones,<lb/>
occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth.<lb/>
Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular<lb/>
whale must have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the cor-<lb/>
responding rib measured but little more than eight feet. So<lb/>
that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n542" n="505"/>
magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now<lb/>
saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round<lb/>
with tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still<lb/>
more, for the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints;<lb/>
and in place of the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes,<lb/>
an utter blank!</p>
<p>How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled<lb/>
man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by<lb/>
merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in<lb/>
this peaceful wood. No. Only in the heart of quickest perils;<lb/>
only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes; only on the<lb/>
profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale be truly<lb/>
and livingly found out.</p>
<p>But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is,<lb/>
with a crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy<lb/>
enterprise. But now it&#x0027;s done, it looks much like Pompey&#x0027;s<lb/>
Pillar.</p>
<p>There are forty and odd vertebr&#x00E6; in all, which in the skeleton<lb/>
are not locked together. They mostly lie like the great knob-<lb/>
bed blocks on a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy<lb/>
masonry. The largest, a middle one, is in width something<lb/>
less than three feet, and in depth more than four. The small-<lb/>
est, where the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two inches<lb/>
in width, and looks something like a white billiard-ball. I was<lb/>
told that there were still smaller ones, but they had been lost<lb/>
by some little cannibal urchins, the priest&#x0027;s children, who had<lb/>
stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the<lb/>
spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into<lb/>
simple child&#x0027;s play.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">From</hi> his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme<lb/>
whereon to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would<lb/>
you, you could not compress him. By good rights he should<lb/>
only be treated of in imperial folio. Not to tell over again his<lb/>
furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about<lb/>
the waist; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines,<lb/>
where they lie in him like great cables and hausers coiled away<lb/>
in the subterranean orlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.</p>
<p>Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it<lb/>
behoves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the<lb/>
enterprise; not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his<lb/>
blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels.<lb/>
Having already described him in most of his present habitatory<lb/>
and anatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in<lb/>
an arch&#x00E6;ological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view.<lb/>
Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan&#x2014;to an ant<lb/>
or a flea&#x2014;such portly terms might justly be deemed unwar-<lb/>
rantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the<lb/>
case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the<lb/>
weightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that<lb/>
whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of<lb/>
these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition<lb/>
of Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that<lb/>
famous lexicographer&#x0027;s uncommon personal bulk more fitted<lb/>
him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me.</p>
<p>One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their sub-<lb/>
ject, though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n544" n="507"/>
with me, writing of this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chiro-<lb/>
graphy expands into placard capitals. Give me a condor&#x0027;s quill!<lb/>
Give me Vesuvius&#x0027; crater for an inkstand! Friends, hold my<lb/>
arms! For in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this<lb/>
Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their out-<lb/>
reaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the<lb/>
whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales,<lb/>
and men, and mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all<lb/>
the revolving panoramas of empire on earth, and throughout<lb/>
the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs. Such, and so<lb/>
magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We<lb/>
expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must<lb/>
choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can<lb/>
ever be written on the flea, though many there be who have tried<lb/>
it.</p>
<p>Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my<lb/>
credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous<lb/>
time I have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of<lb/>
ditches, canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all<lb/>
sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the<lb/>
reader, that while in the earlier geological strata there are<lb/>
found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct;<lb/>
the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the Tertiary<lb/>
formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted<lb/>
links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose<lb/>
remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the<lb/>
Fossil Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period,<lb/>
which is the last preceding the superficial formations. And<lb/>
though none of them precisely answer to any known species of<lb/>
the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general<lb/>
respects, to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils.</p>
<p>Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of<lb/>
their bones and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at<lb/>
various intervals, been found at the base of the Alps, in Lom-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n545" n="508"/>
bardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of<lb/>
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious<lb/>
of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was<lb/>
disinterred in the Rue Dauphin&#x00E9; in Paris, a short street open-<lb/>
ing almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones<lb/>
disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napo-<lb/>
leon&#x0027;s time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged<lb/>
to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species.</p>
<p>But by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the<lb/>
almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in<lb/>
the year 1842, on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama.<lb/>
The awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the<lb/>
bones of one of the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors<lb/>
declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the name of<lb/>
Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being taken<lb/>
across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out<lb/>
that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species.<lb/>
A significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated<lb/>
in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little<lb/>
clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen re-<lb/>
christened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before<lb/>
the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one<lb/>
of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the<lb/>
globe have blotted out of existence.</p>
<p>When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons,<lb/>
skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs, and vertebr&#x00E6;, all characterized by partial<lb/>
resemblances to the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the<lb/>
same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the<lb/>
annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable seniors;<lb/>
I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time<lb/>
itself can be said to have begun; for time began with man.<lb/>
Here Saturn&#x0027;s grey chaos rolls over me, and I obtain dim, shud-<lb/>
dering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged<lb/>
bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n546" n="509"/>
and in all the 25,000 miles of this world&#x0027;s circumference, not an<lb/>
inhabitable hand&#x0027;s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole<lb/>
world was the whale&#x0027;s; and, king of creation, he left his wake<lb/>
along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who<lb/>
can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab&#x0027;s harpoon had shed<lb/>
older blood than the Pharaoh&#x0027;s. Methuselah seems a school-<lb/>
boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I am horror-<lb/>
struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the unspeakable<lb/>
terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time, must<lb/>
needs exist after all humane ages are over.</p>
<p>But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces<lb/>
in the stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl<lb/>
bequeathed his ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose<lb/>
antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous charac-<lb/>
ter, we find the unmistakable print of his fin. In an apartment<lb/>
of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was<lb/>
discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted<lb/>
planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar<lb/>
to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns.<lb/>
Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there<lb/>
swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was<lb/>
cradled.</p>
<p>Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the<lb/>
antiquity of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality,<lb/>
as set down by the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary travel-<lb/>
ler.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters<lb/>
and Beams of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales<lb/>
of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore.<lb/>
The Common People imagine, that by a secret Power bestowed<lb/>
by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it without imme-<lb/>
diate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either side<lb/>
of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the<lb/>
Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon &#x0027;em. They<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n547" n="510"/>
keep a Whale&#x0027;s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which<lb/>
lying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes<lb/>
an Arch, the Head of which cannot be reached by a Man upon<lb/>
a Camel&#x0027;s Back. This Rib (says John Leo) is said to have layn<lb/>
there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their Historians affirm,<lb/>
that a Prophet who prophesy&#x0027;d of Mahomet, came from this<lb/>
Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet<lb/>
Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Tem-<lb/>
ple.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and<lb/>
if you be a Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently wor-<lb/>

<hi rend="sc">does the whale&#x0027;s magnitude diminish?&#x2014;will he perish</hi>?.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">In asmuch</hi>, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down<lb/>
upon us from the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly<lb/>
inquired, whether, in the long course of his generations, he has not<lb/>
degenerated from the original bulk of his sires.</p>
<p>But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales<lb/>
of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil<lb/>
remains are found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct<lb/>
geological period prior to man), but of the whales found in that<lb/>
Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed in<lb/>
size those of its earlier ones.</p>
<p>Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest<lb/>
is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was<lb/>
less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we<lb/>
have already seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet<lb/>
for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n548" n="511"/>
heard, on whalemen&#x0027;s authority, that Sperm Whales have been<lb/>
captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture.</p>
<p>But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour<lb/>
are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geolo-<lb/>
gical periods; may it not be, that since Adam&#x0027;s time they have<lb/>
degenerated?</p>
<p>Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the<lb/>
accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient natural-<lb/>
ists generally. For Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres<lb/>
of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight<lb/>
hundred feet in length&#x2014;Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of<lb/>
Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke&#x0027;s<lb/>
naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences<lb/>
setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrink-<lb/>
led Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three<lb/>
hundred and sixty feet. And Lac&#x00E9;p&#x00E8;de, the French naturalist,<lb/>
in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his<lb/>
work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred<lb/>
metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work<lb/>
was published so late as A. D. 1825.</p>
<p>But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The<lb/>
whale of to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny&#x0027;s time. And<lb/>
if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was),<lb/>
will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot understand<lb/>
how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried<lb/>
thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure<lb/>
so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;<lb/>
and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest<lb/>
Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in<lb/>
which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred,<lb/>
stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed<lb/>
in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh&#x0027;s fat kine; in the face<lb/>
of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone<lb/>
should have degenerated.</p>
<pb xml:id="n549" n="512"/>
<p>But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the<lb/>
more recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost<lb/>
omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now<lb/>
penetrating even through Behring&#x0027;s straits, and into the remotest<lb/>
secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand har-<lb/>
poons and lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot<lb/>
point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase,<lb/>
and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last be<lb/>
exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last<lb/>
man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the<lb/>
final puff.</p>
<p>Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped<lb/>
herds of buffalo, which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens<lb/>
of thousands the prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook<lb/>
their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted brows<lb/>
upon the sites of populous river-capitals, where now the polite<lb/>
broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a comparison<lb/>
an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that<lb/>
the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.</p>
<p>But you must look at this matter in every light. Though<lb/>
so short a period ago&#x2014;not a good life-time&#x2014;the census of the<lb/>
buffalo in Illinois exceeded the census of men now in London,<lb/>
and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them<lb/>
remains in all that region; and though the cause of this<lb/>
wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far<lb/>
different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so<lb/>
inglorious an end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship<lb/>
hunting the Sperm Whale for forty-eight months think they<lb/>
have done extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry<lb/>
home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days of the old<lb/>
Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when<lb/>
the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness<lb/>
and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the<lb/>
same number of months, mounted on horse instead of sailing<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n550" n="513"/>
in ships, would have slain not forty, but forty thousand and<lb/>
more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could be statistically<lb/>
stated.</p>
<p>Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favor<lb/>
of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that<lb/>
in former years (the latter part of the last century, say) these<lb/>
Leviathans, in small pods, were encountered much oftener than<lb/>
at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so<lb/>
prolonged, and were also much more remunerative. Because,<lb/>
as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by<lb/>
some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans,<lb/>
so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and<lb/>
pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into<lb/>
vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all.<lb/>
And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the<lb/>
so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in<lb/>
former years abounding with them, hence that species also<lb/>
is declining. For they are only being driven from promontory<lb/>
to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets,<lb/>
then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very<lb/>
recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.</p>
<p>Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans,<lb/>
they have two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability,<lb/>
will for ever remain impregnable. And as upon the invasion<lb/>
of their valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to their<lb/>
mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the<lb/>
middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their<lb/>
Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers<lb/>
and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a<lb/>
charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all<lb/>
pursuit from man.</p>
<p>But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are<lb/>
harpooned for one cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle<lb/>
have concluded that this positive havoc has already very<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n551" n="514"/>
seriously diminished their battalions. But though for some<lb/>
time past a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have<lb/>
been annually slain on the nor&#x0027; west coast by the Americans<lb/>
alone; yet there are considerations which render even this<lb/>
circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument<lb/>
in this matter.</p>
<p>Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the<lb/>
populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe,<lb/>
yet what shall we say to Harto, the historian of Goa, when he<lb/>
tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took 4000<lb/>
elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves<lb/>
of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason<lb/>
to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted<lb/>
for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal,<lb/>
and by all the successive monarchs of the East&#x2014;if they still<lb/>
survive there in great numbers, much more may the great<lb/>
whale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate<lb/>
in, which is precisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas,<lb/>
Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles of the sea<lb/>
combined.</p>
<p>Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great<lb/>
longevity of whales, their probably attaining the age of a<lb/>
century and more, therefore at any one period of time, several<lb/>
distinct adult generations must be contemporary. And what<lb/>
that is, we may soon gain some idea of, by imagining all the<lb/>
grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of creation yielding<lb/>
up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children who<lb/>
were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless<lb/>
host to the present human population of the globe.</p>
<p>Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale<lb/>
immortal in his species, however perishable in his individuality.<lb/>
He swam the seas before the continents broke water; he once<lb/>
swam over the site of the Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and<lb/>
the Kremlin. In Noah&#x0027;s flood he despised Noah&#x0027;s Ark; and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n552" n="515"/>
if ever the world is to be again flooded, like the Netherlands,<lb/>
to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will still survive, and<lb/>
rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood, spout<lb/>
his frothed defiance to the skies.</p>

<hi rend="sc">ahab&#x0027;s leg</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted<lb/>
the Samuel Enderby of London, had not been unattended with<lb/>
some small violence to his own person. He had lighted with<lb/>
such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had<lb/>
received a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his<lb/>
own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently<lb/>
wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it<lb/>
was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly<lb/>
enough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an addi-<lb/>
tional twist and wrench, that though it still remained entire, and<lb/>
to all appearances lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely<lb/>
trustworthy.</p>
<p>And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all<lb/>
his pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful<lb/>
heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly<lb/>
stood. For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod&#x0027;s<lb/>
sailing from Nantucket, that he had been found one night lying<lb/>
prone upon the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and<lb/>
seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb<lb/>
having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise<lb/>
smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without<lb/>
extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.</p>
<p>Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind,<lb/>
that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n553" n="516"/>
direct issue of a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see,<lb/>
that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his<lb/>
kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove; so,<lb/>
equally with every felicity, all miserable events do naturally<lb/>
beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since<lb/>
both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the<lb/>
ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it<lb/>
is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some<lb/>
natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for<lb/>
the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the<lb/>
joy-childlessness of all hell&#x0027;s despair; whereas, some guilty mor-<lb/>
tal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally<lb/>
progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint<lb/>
of this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of<lb/>
the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly<lb/>
felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in<lb/>
them, but, at bottom, all heart-woes, a mystic significance, and,<lb/>
in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent<lb/>
tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To trail the<lb/>
genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last<lb/>
among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in<lb/>
the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft-cymballing,<lb/>
round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the<lb/>
gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad<lb/>
birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in<lb/>
the signers.</p>
<p>Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps<lb/>
might more properly, in set way, have been disclosed before.<lb/>
With many other particulars concerning Ahab, always had it<lb/>
remained a mystery to some, why it was, that for a certain<lb/>
period, both before and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had<lb/>
hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness;<lb/>
and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as it were,<lb/>
among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg&#x0027;s bruited<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n554" n="517"/>
reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though,<lb/>
indeed, as touching all Ahab&#x0027;s deeper part, every revelation par-<lb/>
took more of significant darkness than of explanatory light.<lb/>
But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.<lb/>
That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluse-<lb/>
ness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping<lb/>
circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a<lb/>
less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the above<lb/>
hinted casualty&#x2014;remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for<lb/>
by Ahab&#x2014;invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived<lb/>
from the land of spirits and of wails. So that, through their<lb/>
zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them lay, to<lb/>
muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence<lb/>
it was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it<lb/>
transpire upon the Pequod&#x0027;s decks.</p>
<p>But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in<lb/>
the air, or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to<lb/>
do or not with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his<lb/>
leg, he took plain practical procedures;&#x2014;he called the<lb/>
carpenter.</p>
<p>And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade<lb/>
him without delay set about making a new leg, and directed<lb/>
the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of<lb/>
jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus far been accumulated<lb/>
on the voyage, in order that a careful selection of the stoutest,<lb/>
clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the carpenter<lb/>
received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to<lb/>
provide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to<lb/>
the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship&#x0027;s forge was<lb/>
ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold;<lb/>
and, to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to<lb/>
proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances<lb/>
might be needed.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the carpenter</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Seat</hi> thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and<lb/>
take high abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a<lb/>
grandeur, and a woe. But from the same point, take mankind<lb/>
in mass, and for the most part, they seem a mob of unnecessary<lb/>
duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary. But most hum-<lb/>
ble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of the<lb/>
high, humane abstraction; the Pequod&#x0027;s carpenter was no<lb/>
duplicate; hence, he now comes in person on this stage.</p>
<p>Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those<lb/>
belonging to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed,<lb/>
practical extent, alike experienced in numerous trades and call-<lb/>
ings collateral to his own; the carpenter&#x0027;s pursuit being the<lb/>
ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts<lb/>
which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary mate-<lb/>
rial. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark<lb/>
above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in<lb/>
those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually<lb/>
recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years&#x0027; voyage, in<lb/>
uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readi-<lb/>
ness in ordinary duties:&#x2014;repairing stove boats, sprung spars,<lb/>
reforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull&#x0027;s eyes<lb/>
in the deck, or new tree-nails in the side planks, and other<lb/>
miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special<lb/>
business; he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner<lb/>
of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.</p>
<p>The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts<lb/>
so manifold, was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table<lb/>
furnished with several vices, of different sizes, and both of iron<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n556" n="519"/>
and of wood. At all times except when whales were alongside,<lb/>
this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of<lb/>
the Try-works.</p>
<p>A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into<lb/>
its hole: the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices,<lb/>
and straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange<lb/>
plumage strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean<lb/>
shaved rods of right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm<lb/>
whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it.<lb/>
An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing<lb/>
lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the<lb/>
blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood,<lb/>
the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor<lb/>
takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills<lb/>
his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers,<lb/>
and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;<lb/>
but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded<lb/>
operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the<lb/>
carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have<lb/>
him draw the tooth.</p>
<p>Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike in-<lb/>
different and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits<lb/>
of ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he<lb/>
lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field<lb/>
thus variously accomplished, and with such liveliness of expert-<lb/>
ness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon<lb/>
vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was<lb/>
this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity<lb/>
as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the sur-<lb/>
rounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general<lb/>
stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while<lb/>
pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its<lb/>
peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathe-<lb/>
drals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n557" n="520"/>
as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;&#x2014;yet was it oddly<lb/>
dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing<lb/>
humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain<lb/>
grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time<lb/>
during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah&#x0027;s<lb/>
ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wan-<lb/>
derer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered<lb/>
no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small<lb/>
outward clingings might have originally pertained to him?<lb/>
He was a stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompro-<lb/>
mised as a new-born babe; living without premeditated reference<lb/>
to this world or the next. You might almost say, that this<lb/>
strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelli-<lb/>
gence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so<lb/>
much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been<lb/>
tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven;<lb/>
but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal<lb/>
process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever<lb/>
had one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his<lb/>
fingers. He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly<lb/>
useful, <hi rend="i">multum in parvo</hi>, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the<lb/>
exterior&#x2014;though a little swelled&#x2014;of a common pocket knife;<lb/>
but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-<lb/>
drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, coun-<lb/>
tersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for<lb/>
a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of<lb/>
him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by<lb/>
the legs, and there they were.</p>
<p>Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut<lb/>
carpenter, was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If<lb/>
he did not have a common soul in him, he had a subtle some-<lb/>
thing that somehow anomalously did its duty. What that was,<lb/>
whether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there<lb/>
is no telling. But there it was; and there it had abided for<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n558" n="521"/>
now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same<lb/>
unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that<lb/>
kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like<lb/>
an unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or<lb/>
rather, his body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard<lb/>
there, and talking all the time to keep himself awake.</p>

a leg now as ever (<hi rend="i">sneezes</hi>) scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those<lb/>
buckskin legs and calves of legs I&#x0027;ve seen in shop windows<lb/>
wouldn&#x0027;t compare at all. They soak water, they do; and of<lb/>
course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (<hi rend="i">sneezes</hi>) with<lb/>
washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before I saw it<lb/>
off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the<lb/>
length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha!<lb/>
that&#x0027;s the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it&#x0027;s some-<lb/>

<p>Well, manmaker!</p>
<p>Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the<lb/>
length. Let me measure, sir.</p>
<p>Measured for a leg! good. Well, it&#x0027;s not the first time.<lb/>
About it! There; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent<lb/>
vice thou hast here, carpenter; let me feel its grip once. So,<lb/>
so; it does pinch some.</p>
<p>Oh, sir, it will break bones&#x2014;beware, beware!</p>
<p>No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this<lb/>
slippery world that can hold, man. What&#x0027;s Prometheus about<lb/>
there?&#x2014;the blacksmith, I mean&#x2014;what&#x0027;s he about?</p>
<p>He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.</p>
<p>Right. It&#x0027;s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part.<lb/>
He makes a fierce red flame there!</p>
<p>Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine<lb/>
work.</p>
<p>Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning<lb/>
thing, that that old Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they<lb/>
say, should have been a blacksmith, and animated them with<lb/>
fire; for what&#x0027;s made in fire must properly belong to fire;<lb/>
and so hell&#x0027;s probable. How the soot flies! This must be the<lb/>
remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter, when<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n560" n="523"/>
he&#x0027;s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel<lb/>
shoulder-blades; there&#x0027;s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.</p>
<p>Sir?</p>
<p>Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I&#x0027;ll order a complete<lb/>
man after a desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his<lb/>
socks; then, chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then,<lb/>
legs with roots to &#x0027;em, to stay in one place; then, arms three<lb/>
feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass forehead, and<lb/>
about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see&#x2014;shall<lb/>
I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top<lb/>
of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and<lb/>
away.</p>
<p>Now, what&#x0027;s he speaking about, and who&#x0027;s he speaking to, I<lb/>
should like to know? Shall I keep standing here? (<hi rend="i">aside.</hi>)</p>
<p>&#x0027;Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here&#x0027;s<lb/>
one. No, no, no; I must have a lantern.</p>
<p>Ho, ho! That&#x0027;s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve<lb/>
my turn.</p>
<p>What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for,<lb/>
man? Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.</p>
<p>I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.</p>
<p>Carpenter? why that&#x0027;s&#x2014;but no;&#x2014;a very tidy, and, I may<lb/>
say, an extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here,<lb/>
carpenter;&#x2014;or would&#x0027;st thou rather work in clay?</p>
<p>Sir?&#x2014;Clay? clay, sir? That&#x0027;s mud; we leave clay to<lb/>
ditchers, sir.</p>
<p>The fellow&#x0027;s impious! What art thou sneezing about?</p>
<p>Bone is rather dusty, sir.</p>
<p>Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury<lb/>
thyself under living people&#x0027;s noses.</p>
<p>Sir?&#x2014;oh! ah!&#x2014;I guess so;&#x2014;yes&#x2014;oh, dear!</p>
<p>Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right<lb/>
good workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak<lb/>
thoroughly well for thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n561" n="524"/>
thou makest, I shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same<lb/>
identical place with it; that is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the<lb/>
flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst thou not drive that old<lb/>
Adam away?</p>
<p>Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I<lb/>
have heard something curious on that score, sir; how that a<lb/>
dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar,<lb/>
but it will be still pricking him at times. May I humbly ask<lb/>
if it be really so, sir?</p>
<p>It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where<lb/>
mine once was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye,<lb/>
yet two to the soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there,<lb/>
exactly there, there to a hair, do I. Is&#x0027;t a riddle?</p>
<p>I should humbly call it a poser, sir.</p>
<p>Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living,<lb/>
thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly<lb/>
standing precisely where thou now standest; aye, and standing<lb/>
there in thy spite? In thy most solitary hours, then, dost thou<lb/>
not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don&#x0027;t speak! And if I still<lb/>
feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dis-<lb/>
solved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains<lb/>
of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!</p>
<p>Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate<lb/>
over again; I think I didn&#x0027;t carry a small figure, sir.</p>
<p>Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.&#x2014;How<lb/>
long before the leg is done?</p>
<p>Perhaps an hour, sir.</p>
<p>Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (<hi rend="i">turns to go</hi>).<lb/>
Oh, Life! Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing<lb/>
debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be<lb/>
that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away with<lb/>
ledgers. I would be free as air; and I&#x0027;m down in the whole<lb/>
world&#x0027;s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid<lb/>
with the wealthiest Pr&#x00E6;torians at the auction of the Roman<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n562" n="525"/>
empire (which was the world&#x0027;s); and yet I owe for the flesh<lb/>
in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I&#x0027;ll get a crucible, and<lb/>
into it, and dissolve myself down to one small, compendious<lb/>
vertebra. So.</p>

little word queer; he&#x0027;s queer, says Stubb; he&#x0027;s queer&#x2014;queer,<lb/>
queer; and keeps dinning it into Mr. Starbuck all the time&#x2014;queer,<lb/>
sir&#x2014;queer, queer, very queer. And here&#x0027;s his leg! Yes, now<lb/>
that I think of it, here&#x0027;s his bedfellow! has a stick of whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he&#x0027;ll stand on this.<lb/>
What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and<lb/>
all three places standing in one hell&#x2014;how was that? Oh! I<lb/>
don&#x0027;t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I&#x0027;m a sort of<lb/>
strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that&#x0027;s only hap-<lb/>
hazard-like. Then, a short, little old body like me, should<lb/>
never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-<lb/>
built captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty<lb/>
quick, and there&#x0027;s a great cry for life-boats. And here&#x0027;s the<lb/>
heron&#x0027;s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks<lb/>
one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they<lb/>
use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-<lb/>
poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he&#x0027;s a hard driver.<lb/>
Look, driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life,<lb/>

before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for<lb/>

beer barrels, to fill &#x0027;em up again. What a leg this is! It<lb/>
looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core;<lb/>
he&#x0027;ll be standing on this to-morrow; he&#x0027;ll be taking altitudes<lb/>
on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval slate, smoothed<lb/>

<p><hi rend="sc">According</hi> to usage they were pumping the ship next<lb/>
morning; and lo! no inconsiderable oil came up with the water;<lb/>
the casks below must have sprung a bad leak. Much concern<lb/>
was shown; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report<lb/>
this unfavorable affair.<note xml:id="fn21-526"><p>In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board,<lb/>
it is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and<lb/>
drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals,<lb/>
is removed by the ship&#x0027;s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be<lb/>
kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the withdrawn<lb/>
water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious<lb/>
cargo.</p></note></p>
<p>Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing<lb/>
nigh to Formosa and the Bashee Isles, between which lies one<lb/>
of the tropical outlets from the China waters into the Pacific.<lb/>
And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the<lb/>
oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another separate<lb/>
one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands&#x2014;<lb/>
Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new<lb/>
ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with<lb/>
a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous<lb/>
old man, with his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his<lb/>
brow, and tracing his old courses again.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who&#x0027;s there?&#x201D; hearing the footstep at the door, but not<lb/>
turning round to it. &#x201C;On deck! Begone!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is<lb/>
leaking, sir. We must up Burtons and break out.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n564" n="527"/>
<p>&#x201C;Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing<lb/>
Japan; heave-to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we<lb/>
may make good in a year. What we come twenty thousand<lb/>
miles to get is worth saving, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;So it is, so it is; if we get it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Be-<lb/>
gone! Let it leak! I&#x0027;m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in<lb/>
leaks! not only full of leaky casks, but those leaky casks are in<lb/>
a leaky ship; and that&#x0027;s a far worse plight than the Pequod&#x0027;s,<lb/>
man. Yet I don&#x0027;t stop to plug my leak; for who can find it in<lb/>
the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if found, in<lb/>
this life&#x0027;s howling gale? Starbuck! I&#x0027;ll not have the Burtons<lb/>
hoisted.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What will the owners say, sir?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the<lb/>
Typhoons. What cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art<lb/>
always prating to me, Starbuck, about those miserly owners, as<lb/>
if the owners were my conscience. But look ye, the only real<lb/>
owner of anything is its commander; and hard ye, my con-<lb/>
science is in this ship&#x0027;s keel.&#x2014;On deck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab,&#x201D; said the reddening mate, moving further<lb/>
into the cabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious<lb/>
that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the<lb/>
slightest outward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed<lb/>
more than half distrustful of itself; &#x201C;A better man than I might<lb/>
well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a<lb/>
younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think<lb/>
of me?&#x2014;On deck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir&#x2014;to be<lb/>
forbearing! Shall we not understand each other better than<lb/>
hitherto, Captain Ahab?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n565" n="528"/>
<p>Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of<lb/>
most South-Sea-men&#x0027;s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards<lb/>
Starbuck, exclaimed: &#x201C;There is one God that is Lord over the<lb/>
earth, and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod.&#x2014;On<lb/>
deck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery<lb/>
cheeks, you would have almost thought that he had really<lb/>
received the blaze of the levelled tube. But, mastering his<lb/>
emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused<lb/>
for an instant and said: &#x201C;Thou hast outraged, not insulted<lb/>
me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou<lb/>
wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware<lb/>
of thyself, old man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lie waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful<lb/>
bravery that!&#x201D; murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared.<lb/>
&#x201C;What&#x0027;s that he said&#x2014;Ahab beware of Ahab&#x2014;there&#x0027;s some-<lb/>
thing there!&#x201D; Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff,<lb/>
with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but<lb/>
presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning<lb/>
the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,&#x201D; he said lowly<lb/>
to the mate; then raising his voice to the crew: &#x201C;Furl the<lb/>
t&#x0027;gallant-sails, and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the<lb/>
main-yard; up Burtons, and break out in the main-hold.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as<lb/>
respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a<lb/>
flash of honesty in him; or mere prudential policy which, under<lb/>
the circumstance, imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of<lb/>
open disaffection, however transient, in the important chief officer<lb/>
of his ship. However it was, his orders were executed; and the<lb/>
Burtons were hoisted.</p>

<hi rend="sc">queequeg in his coffin</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Upon</hi> searching, it was found that the casks last struck into<lb/>
the hold were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further<lb/>
off. So, it being calm weather, they broke out deeper and<lb/>
deeper, disturbing the slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts;<lb/>
and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into<lb/>
the daylight above. So deep did they go; and so ancient, and<lb/>
corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons,<lb/>
that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask<lb/>
containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted<lb/>
placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.<lb/>
Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks<lb/>
of staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at<lb/>
last the piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow<lb/>
hull echoed under foot, as if you were treading over empty<lb/>
catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air-freighted<lb/>
demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with<lb/>
all Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons did<lb/>
not visit them then.</p>
<p>Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and<lb/>
fast bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which<lb/>
brought him nigh to his endless end.</p>
<p>Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are un-<lb/>
known; dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to<lb/>
be Captain, the higher you rise the harder you toil. So with<lb/>
poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer, must not only face all the<lb/>
rage of the living whale, but&#x2014;as we have elsewhere seen&#x2014;mount<lb/>
his dead back in a rolling sea; and finally descend into the gloom<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n567" n="530"/>
of the hold, and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous<lb/>
confinement, resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to<lb/>
their stowage. To be short, among whalemen, the harpooneers<lb/>
are the holders, so called.</p>
<p>Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled,<lb/>
you should have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down<lb/>
upon him there; where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tat-<lb/>
tooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime,<lb/>
like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And a well,<lb/>
or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where,<lb/>
strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he caught a ter-<lb/>
rible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after some<lb/>
days&#x0027; suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill of<lb/>
the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those<lb/>
few long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him<lb/>
but his frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and<lb/>
his cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed<lb/>
growing fuller and fuller; they became of a strange softness of<lb/>
lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his<lb/>
sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in<lb/>
him which could not die, or be weakened. And like circles on<lb/>
the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes<lb/>
seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An<lb/>
awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by<lb/>
the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his<lb/>
face, as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died.<lb/>
For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet<lb/>
was put into words or books. And the drawing near of Death,<lb/>
which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation,<lb/>
which only an author from the dead could adequately tell. So<lb/>
that&#x2014;let us say it again&#x2014;no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher<lb/>
and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you<lb/>
saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay<lb/>
in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n568" n="531"/>
rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean&#x0027;s invisible flood-tide<lb/>
lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven.</p>
<p>Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Quee-<lb/>
queg himself, what he thought of his case was forcibly shown<lb/>
by a curious favor he asked. He called one to him in the grey<lb/>
morning watch, when the day was just breaking, and taking his<lb/>
hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see cer-<lb/>
tain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his<lb/>
native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all whale-<lb/>
men who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark<lb/>
canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased<lb/>
him; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who,<lb/>
after embalming a dead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe,<lb/>
and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes;<lb/>
for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far<lb/>
beyond all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas,<lb/>
interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white breakers<lb/>
of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the thought<lb/>
of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual sea-cus-<lb/>
tom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.<lb/>
No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more<lb/>
congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat<lb/>
these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved<lb/>
but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim<lb/>
ages.</p>
<p>Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the<lb/>
carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg&#x0027;s bidding,<lb/>
whatever it might include. There was some heathenish, coffin-<lb/>
colored old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage,<lb/>
had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands,<lb/>
and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be<lb/>
made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than<lb/>
taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude<lb/>
of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Quee-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n569" n="532"/>
queg&#x0027;s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Quee-<lb/>
queg&#x0027;s person as he shifted the rule.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ah! poor fellow! he&#x0027;ll have to die now,&#x201D; ejaculated the<lb/>
Long Island sailor.</p>
<p>Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake<lb/>
and general reference, now transferringly measured on it the<lb/>
exact length the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer<lb/>
permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities. This done,<lb/>
he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work.</p>
<p>When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and<lb/>
fitted, he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it,<lb/>
inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.</p>
<p>Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with<lb/>
which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away,<lb/>
Queequeg, to every one&#x0027;s consternation, commanded that the<lb/>
thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any<lb/>
denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are<lb/>
the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly trouble<lb/>
us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.</p>
<p>Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the<lb/>
coffin with an attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon,<lb/>
had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part<lb/>
placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat.<lb/>
All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round<lb/>
the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head,<lb/>
and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the<lb/>
foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow,<lb/>
Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he<lb/>
might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without<lb/>
moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring<lb/>
out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast<lb/>
with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called<lb/>
it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a<lb/>
leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n570" n="533"/>
but his composed countenance in view. &#x201C;Rarmai&#x201D; (it will do;<lb/>
it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in<lb/>
his hammock.</p>
<p>But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering<lb/>
near by all this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with<lb/>
soft sobbings, took him by the hand; in the other, holding his<lb/>
tambourine.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary<lb/>
roving? where go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to<lb/>
those sweet Antilles where the beaches are only beat with<lb/>
water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for me? Seek out one<lb/>
Pip, who&#x0027;s now been missing long: I think he&#x0027;s in those far<lb/>
Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he must be<lb/>
very sad; for look! he&#x0027;s left his tambourine behind;&#x2014;I found it.<lb/>
Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I&#x0027;ll beat ye your<lb/>
dying march.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have heard,&#x201D; murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle,<lb/>
&#x201C;that in violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient<lb/>
tongues; and that when the mystery is probed, it turns out<lb/>
always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient<lb/>
tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty<lb/>
scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange<lb/>
sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our<lb/>
heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?&#x2014;Hark!<lb/>
he speaks again: but more wildly now.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Form two and two! Let&#x0027;s make a General of him! Ho,<lb/>
where&#x0027;s his harpoon? Lay it across here.&#x2014;Rig-a-dig, dig, dig!<lb/>
huzza! Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow!<lb/>
Queequeg dies game!&#x2014;mind ye that; Queequeg dies game!&#x2014;<lb/>
take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies game! I say; game,<lb/>
game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward; died all<lb/>
a&#x0027;shiver;&#x2014;out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the<lb/>
Antilles he&#x0027;s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell<lb/>
them he jumped from a whale-boat! I&#x0027;d never beat my<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n571" n="534"/>
tambourine over base Pip, and hail him General, if he were<lb/>
once more dying here. No, no! shame upon all cowards&#x2014;<lb/>
shame upon them! Let &#x0027;em go drown like Pip, that jumped<lb/>
from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!&#x201D;</p>
<p>During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a<lb/>
dream. Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in<lb/>
his hammock.</p>
<p>But now that he had apparently made every preparation for<lb/>
death; now that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg<lb/>
suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter&#x0027;s<lb/>
box: and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted sur-<lb/>
prise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden<lb/>
convalescence was this;&#x2014;at a critical moment, he had just<lb/>
recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and<lb/>
therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die<lb/>
yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die<lb/>
was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He<lb/>
answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg&#x0027;s conceit,<lb/>
that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not<lb/>
kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent,<lb/>
ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.</p>
<p>Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and<lb/>
civilized; that while a sick, civilized man may be six months<lb/>
convalescing, generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-<lb/>
well again in a day. So, in good time my Queequeg gained<lb/>
strength; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few<lb/>
indolent days (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly<lb/>
leaped to his feet, threw out arms and legs, gave himself a good<lb/>
stretching, yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head<lb/>
of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself<lb/>
fit for a fight.</p>
<p>With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-<lb/>
chest; and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them<lb/>
in order there. Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n572" n="535"/>
with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings; and it<lb/>
seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy<lb/>
parts of the twisted tattooing on his body. And this tattooing,<lb/>
had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island,<lb/>
who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body<lb/>
a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical<lb/>
treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his<lb/>
own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in<lb/>
one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read,<lb/>
though his own live heart beat against them; and these myste-<lb/>
ries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with<lb/>
the living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be<lb/>
unsolved to the last. And this thought it must have been<lb/>
which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when<lb/>
one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!&#x201D;</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">When</hi> gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon<lb/>
the great South Sea; were it not for other things, I could<lb/>
have greeted my dear Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now<lb/>
the long supplication of my youth was answered; that serene<lb/>
ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue.</p>
<p>There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea,<lb/>
whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul<lb/>
beneath; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod<lb/>
over the buried Evangelist St. John. And meet it is, that over<lb/>
these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters&#x0027;<lb/>
Fields of all four continents, the waves should rise and fall, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n573" n="536"/>
ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades<lb/>
and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all<lb/>
that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still;<lb/>
tossing like slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves<lb/>
but made so by their restlessness.</p>
<p>To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once<lb/>
beheld, must ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the<lb/>
midmost waters of the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic<lb/>
being but its arms. The same waves wash the moles of the<lb/>
new-built Californian towns, but yesterday planted by the<lb/>
recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still gorgeous<lb/>
skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all<lb/>
between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless,<lb/>
unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this<lb/>
mysterious, divine Pacific zones the world&#x0027;s whole bulk about;<lb/>
makes all coasts one bay to it; seems the tide-beating heart of<lb/>
earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you needs must own the<lb/>
seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.</p>
<p>But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab&#x0027;s brain, as standing<lb/>
like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen<lb/>
rigging, with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary<lb/>
musk from the Bashee isles (in whose sweet woods mild lovers<lb/>
must be walking), and with the other consciously inhaled the<lb/>
salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in which the hated<lb/>
White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at<lb/>
length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the<lb/>
Japanese cruising-ground, the old man&#x0027;s purpose intensified<lb/>
itself. His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of<lb/>
his forehead&#x0027;s veins swelled like overladen brooks; in his very<lb/>
sleep, his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull, &#x201C;Stern<lb/>
all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!&#x201D;</p>

<hi rend="sc">the blacksmith</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Availing</hi> himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that<lb/>
now reigned in these latitudes, and in preparation for the<lb/>
peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the<lb/>
begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his<lb/>
portable forge to the hold again, after concluding his contribu-<lb/>
tory work for Ahab&#x0027;s leg, but still retained it on deck, fast<lb/>
lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost inces-<lb/>
santly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen<lb/>
to do some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new<lb/>
shaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he<lb/>
would be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be<lb/>
served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances,<lb/>
and jealously watching his every sooty movement, as he toiled.<lb/>
Nevertheless, this old man&#x0027;s was a patient hammer wielded by<lb/>
a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulence did<lb/>
come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still<lb/>
further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil<lb/>
were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the<lb/>
heavy beating of his heart And so it was.&#x2014;Most miserable!</p>
<p>A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful<lb/>
appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the<lb/>
voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners. And to the<lb/>
importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given<lb/>
in; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shame-<lb/>
ful story of his wretched fate.</p>
<p>Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter&#x0027;s midnight, on<lb/>
the road running between two country towns, the blacksmith<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n575" n="538"/>
half-stupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him, and<lb/>
sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn. The issue was,<lb/>
the loss of the extremities of both feet. Out of this revelation,<lb/>
part by part, at last came out the four acts of the gladness, and<lb/>
the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief<lb/>
of his life&#x0027;s drama.</p>
<p>He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had<lb/>
postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow&#x0027;s technicals<lb/>
called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed excellence, and<lb/>
with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a<lb/>
youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy<lb/>
children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,<lb/>
planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness,<lb/>
and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a<lb/>
desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them<lb/>
all of everything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith him-<lb/>
self did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family&#x0027;s heart.<lb/>
It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of that fatal<lb/>
cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,<lb/>
for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith&#x0027;s<lb/>
shop was in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate<lb/>
entrance to it; so that always had the young and loving<lb/>
healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness, but with<lb/>
vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her young-armed<lb/>
old husband&#x0027;s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing<lb/>
through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in<lb/>
her nursery; and so, to stout Labor&#x0027;s iron lullaby, the black-<lb/>
smith&#x0027;s infants were rocked to slumber.</p>
<p>Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not some-<lb/>
times be timely? Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to<lb/>
thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had the young<lb/>
widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable,<lb/>
legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them<lb/>
a care-killing competency. But Death plucked down some<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n576" n="539"/>
virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung<lb/>
the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse<lb/>
than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should<lb/>
make him easier to harvest.</p>
<p>Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer<lb/>
every day grew more and more between; and each blow<lb/>
every day grew fainter than the last; the wife sat frozen at the<lb/>
window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing into the weeping<lb/>
faces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked up<lb/>
with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived down into<lb/>
the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed her<lb/>
thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a<lb/>
vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey<lb/>
head a scorn to flaxen curls!</p>
<p>Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this;<lb/>
but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange<lb/>
Untried; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the<lb/>
immense Remote, the Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; there-<lb/>
fore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still have left<lb/>
in them some interior compunctions against suicide, does the<lb/>
all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth<lb/>
his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful,<lb/>
new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifies,<lb/>
the thousand mermaids sing to them&#x2014;&#x201C;Come hither, broken-<lb/>
hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate<lb/>
death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them.<lb/>
Come hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally<lb/>
abhorred and abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than<lb/>
death. Come hither! put up <hi rend="i">thy</hi> grave-stone, too, within the<lb/>
churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sun-rise,<lb/>
and by fall of eve, the blacksmith&#x0027;s soul responded, Aye, I<lb/>
come! And so Perth went a-whaling.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">With</hi> matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin<lb/>
apron, about mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge<lb/>
and anvil, the latter placed upon an iron-wood log, with one<lb/>
hand holding a pike-head in the coals, and with the other at his<lb/>
forge&#x0027;s lungs, when Captain Ahab came along, carrying in his<lb/>
hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While yet a little<lb/>
distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last, Perth,<lb/>
withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon<lb/>
the anvil&#x2014;the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hover-<lb/>
ing flights, some of which flew close to Ahab.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Are these thy Mother Carey&#x0027;s chickens, Perth? they are<lb/>
always flying in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly,<lb/>

all misery in others that is not mad. Thou should&#x0027;st go mad,<lb/>
blacksmith; say, why dost thou not go mad? How can&#x0027;st thou<lb/>
endure without being mad? Do the heavens yet hate thee,<lb/>
that thou can&#x0027;st not go mad?&#x2014;What wert thou making there?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents<lb/>
in it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And can&#x0027;st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after<lb/>
such hard usage as it had?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n578" n="541"/>
<p>&#x201C;I think so, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And I suppose thou can&#x0027;st smoothe almost any seams and<lb/>
dents; never mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look ye here, then,&#x201D; cried Ahab, passionately advancing,<lb/>
and leaning with both hands on Perth&#x0027;s shoulders; &#x201C;look ye<lb/>
here&#x2014;<hi rend="i">here</hi>&#x2014;can ye smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,&#x201D;<lb/>
sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow; &#x201C;if thou could&#x0027;st,<lb/>
blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil,<lb/>
and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes. Answer!<lb/>
Can&#x0027;st thou smoothe this seam?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents<lb/>
but one?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmooth-<lb/>
able; for though thou only see&#x0027;st it here in my flesh, it has<lb/>
worked down into the bone of my skull&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that</hi> is all wrinkles!<lb/>
But, away with child&#x0027;s play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day.<lb/>
Look ye here!&#x201D; jingling the leathern bag, as if it were full of<lb/>
gold coins. &#x201C;I, too, want a harpoon made; one that a thou-<lb/>
sand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth; something that will<lb/>
stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There&#x0027;s the stuff,&#x201D; fling-<lb/>
ing the pouch upon the anvil. &#x201C;Look ye, blacksmith, these<lb/>
are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast<lb/>
here, then, the best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever<lb/>
work.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like<lb/>
glue from the melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me<lb/>
the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve rods for its shank;<lb/>
then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like<lb/>
the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I&#x0027;ll blow the<lb/>
fire.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them,<lb/>
one by one, by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n579" n="542"/>
long, heavy iron bolt. &#x201C;A flaw!&#x201D; rejecting the last one.<lb/>
&#x201C;Work that over again, Perth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into<lb/>
one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his<lb/>
own iron. As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered<lb/>
on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after<lb/>
the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense<lb/>
straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his<lb/>
head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some<lb/>
blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?&#x201D;<lb/>
muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. &#x201C;That Parsee<lb/>
smells fire like a fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot<lb/>
musket&#x0027;s powder-pan.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat;<lb/>
and as Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask<lb/>
of water near by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab&#x0027;s bent<lb/>
face.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Would&#x0027;st thou brand me, Perth?&#x201D; wincing for a moment<lb/>
with the pain; &#x201C;have I been but forging my own branding-<lb/>
iron, then?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab.<lb/>
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must<lb/>
make them thyself, man. Here are my razors&#x2014;the best of<lb/>
steel; here, and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the<lb/>
Icy Sea.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though<lb/>
he would fain not use them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now<lb/>
neither shave, sup, nor pray till&#x2014;but here&#x2014;to work!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth<lb/>
to the shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and<lb/>
as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n580" n="543"/>
prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-<lb/>
cask near.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, no&#x2014;no water for that; I want it of the true death-<lb/>
temper. Ahoy, there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What<lb/>
say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much blood as will cover<lb/>
this barb?&#x201D; holding it high up. A cluster of dark nods replied,<lb/>
Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the<lb/>
White Whale&#x0027;s barbs were then tempered.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine<lb/>
diaboli!&#x201D; deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron<lb/>
scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood.</p>
<p>Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one<lb/>
of hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end<lb/>
to the socket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then<lb/>
unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and<lb/>
stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot upon it, till the<lb/>
rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over it,<lb/>
and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, &#x201C;Good! and now<lb/>
for the seizings.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate<lb/>
spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of<lb/>
the harpoon; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket;<lb/>
from the lower end the rope was traced half way along the pole&#x0027;s<lb/>
length, and firmly secured so, with intertwistings of twine. This<lb/>
done, pole, iron, and rope&#x2014;like the Three Fates&#x2014;remained<lb/>
inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon;<lb/>
the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory pole,<lb/>
both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered<lb/>
his cabin, a light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous<lb/>
sound was heard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but<lb/>
unresting eye; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly<lb/>
blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and<lb/>
mocked it!</p>

<hi rend="sc">the gilder</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Penetrating</hi> further and further into the heart of the Japanese<lb/>
cruising ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery.<lb/>
Often, in mild, pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and<lb/>
twenty hours on the stretch, they were engaged in the boats,<lb/>
steadily pulling, or sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an<lb/>
interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their<lb/>
uprising; though with but small success for their pains.</p>
<p>At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon<lb/>
smooth, slow heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch<lb/>
canoe; and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves,<lb/>
that like hearth-stone cats they purr against the gunwale; these<lb/>
are the times of dreamy quietude, when beholding the tranquil<lb/>
beauty and brilliancy of the ocean&#x0027;s skin, one forgets the tiger<lb/>
heart that pants beneath it; and would not willingly remember,<lb/>
that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.</p>
<p>These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly<lb/>
feels a certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea;<lb/>
that he regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant<lb/>
ship revealing only the tops of her masts, seems struggling for-<lb/>
ward, not through high rolling waves, but through the tall grass<lb/>
of a rolling prairie: as when the western emigrants&#x0027; horses only<lb/>
show their erected ears, while their hidden bodies widely wade<lb/>
through the amazing verdure.</p>
<p>The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as<lb/>
over these there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear<lb/>
that play-wear ied children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in<lb/>
some glad May-time, when the flowers of the woods are plucked.<lb/>
And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that fact<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n582" n="545"/>
and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one seam-<lb/>
less whole.</p>
<p>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at<lb/>
least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden<lb/>
keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries,<lb/>
yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing.</p>
<p>Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul;<lb/>
in ye,&#x2014;though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy<lb/>
life,&#x2014;in ye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning<lb/>
clover; and for some few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of<lb/>
the life immortal on them. Would to God these blessed calms<lb/>
would last. But the mingled, mingling threads of life are woven<lb/>
by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a storm for every calm.<lb/>
There is no steady unretracing progress in this life; we<lb/>
do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one<lb/>
pause:&#x2014;through infancy&#x0027;s unconscious spell, boyhood&#x0027;s thought-<lb/>
less faith, adolescence&#x0027; doubt (the common doom), then scepti-<lb/>
cism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood&#x0027;s pondering<lb/>
repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again;<lb/>
and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies<lb/>
the final harbor, whence we unmoor no more? In what rapt<lb/>
ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary?<lb/>
Where is the foundling&#x0027;s father hidden? Our souls are like those<lb/>
orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the<lb/>
secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to<lb/>
learn it.</p>
<p>And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat&#x0027;s side<lb/>
into that same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young<lb/>
bride&#x0027;s eye!&#x2014;Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy<lb/>
kidnapping cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust<lb/>
memory; I look deep down and do believe.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that<lb/>
same golden light:&#x2014;</p>
<pb xml:id="n583" n="546"/>
<p>&#x201C;I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb<lb/>
takes oaths that he has always been jolly!&#x201D;</p>

<head>CHAPTER CXV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the pequod meets the bachelor</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">And</hi> jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came<lb/>
bearing down before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
harpoon had been welded.</p>
<p>It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged<lb/>
in her last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches;<lb/>
and now, in glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though some-<lb/>
what vain-gloriously, sailing round among the widely-separated<lb/>
ships on the ground, previous to pointing her prow for home.</p>
<p>The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of nar-<lb/>
row red bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat<lb/>
was suspended, bottom down; and hanging captive from the<lb/>
bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they<lb/>
had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colors were flying<lb/>
from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of<lb/>
her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which,<lb/>
in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same<lb/>
precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen<lb/>
lamp.</p>
<p>As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the<lb/>
most surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while<lb/>
cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone<lb/>
entire months without securing a single fish. Not only had<lb/>
barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for<lb/>
the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks<lb/>
had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n584" n="547"/>
were stowed along the deck, and in the captain&#x0027;s and officers&#x0027;<lb/>
state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into<lb/>
kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head<lb/>
of an oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the<lb/>
forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their<lb/>
chests, and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook<lb/>
had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the<lb/>
steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the<lb/>
harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled<lb/>
them; that indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the<lb/>
captain&#x0027;s pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved to thrust<lb/>
his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire satis-<lb/>
faction.</p>
<p>As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody<lb/>
Pequod, the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her<lb/>
forecastle; and drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were<lb/>
seen standing round her huge try-pots, which, covered with the<lb/>
parchment-like <hi rend="i">poke</hi> or stomach skin of the black fish, gave forth<lb/>
a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew.<lb/>
On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing<lb/>
with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the<lb/>
Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,<lb/>
firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three<lb/>
Long Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory,<lb/>
were presiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the<lb/>
ship&#x0027;s company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the<lb/>
try-works, from which the huge pots had been removed. You<lb/>
would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed<lb/>
Bastile, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick<lb/>
and mortar were being hurled into the sea.</p>
<p>Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect<lb/>
on the ship&#x0027;s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing<lb/>
drama was full before him, and seemed merely contrived for<lb/>
his own individual diversion.</p>
<pb xml:id="n585" n="548"/>
<p>And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy<lb/>
and black, with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed<lb/>
each other&#x0027;s wakes&#x2014;one all jubilations for things passed, the<lb/>
other all forebodings as to things to come&#x2014;their two captains<lb/>
in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the<lb/>
scene.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come aboard, come aboard!&#x201D; cried the gay Bachelor&#x0027;s com-<lb/>
mander, lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hast seen the White Whale?&#x201D; gritted Ahab in reply.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No; only heard of him; but don&#x0027;t believe in him at all,&#x201D;<lb/>
said the other good-humoredly. &#x201C;Come aboard!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any<lb/>
men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not enough to speak of&#x2014;two islanders, that&#x0027;s all;&#x2014;but<lb/>
come aboard, old hearty, come along. I&#x0027;ll soon take that black<lb/>
from your brow. Come along, will ye (merry&#x0027;s the play); a<lb/>
full ship and homeward-bound.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;How wondrous familiar is a fool!&#x201D; muttered Ahab; then<lb/>
aloud, &#x201C;Thou art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst;<lb/>
well, then, call me an empty ship, and outward-bound. So go<lb/>
thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there! Set all sail, and<lb/>
keep her to the wind!&#x201D;</p>
<p>And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze,<lb/>
the other stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels<lb/>
parted; the crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering<lb/>
glances towards the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor&#x0027;s<lb/>
men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were<lb/>
in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the home-<lb/>
ward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand,<lb/>
and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby<lb/>
bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was filled<lb/>
with Nantucket soundings.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Not</hi> seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune&#x0027;s<lb/>
favorites sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch<lb/>
somewhat of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging<lb/>
sails fill out. So seemed it with the Pequod. For next day<lb/>
after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and four<lb/>
were slain; and one of them by Ahab.</p>
<p>It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of<lb/>
the crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset<lb/>
sea and sky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such<lb/>
a sweetness and such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons<lb/>
curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over<lb/>
from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the<lb/>
Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea,<lb/>
freighted with these vesper hymns.</p>
<p>Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who<lb/>
had sterned off from the whale, sat intently watching his final<lb/>
wanings from the now tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle<lb/>
observable in all sperm whales dying&#x2014;the turning sunwards of<lb/>
the head, and so expiring&#x2014;that strange spectacle, beheld of<lb/>
such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a wondrous-<lb/>
ness unknown before.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He turns and turns him to it,&#x2014;how slowly, but how stead-<lb/>
fastly, his homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his<lb/>
last dying motions. He too worships fire; most faithful, broad,<lb/>
baronial vassal of the sun!&#x2014;Oh that these too-favoring eyes<lb/>
should see these too-favoring sights. Look! here, far water-<lb/>
locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in these most<lb/>
candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks furnish<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n587" n="550"/>
tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still rolled<lb/>
on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the<lb/>
Niger&#x0027;s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of<lb/>
faith; but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the<lb/>
corpse, and it heads some other way.&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones<lb/>
hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of<lb/>
these unverdured seas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too<lb/>
truly speakest to me in the wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the<lb/>
hushed burial of its after calm. Nor has this thy whale sun-<lb/>
wards turned his dying head, and then gone round again, with-<lb/>
out a lesson to me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power? Oh, high aspir-<lb/>
ing, rainbowed jet!&#x2014;that one strivest, this one jettest all in<lb/>
vain! In vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with you<lb/>
all-quickening sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not<lb/>
again. Yet dost thou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if<lb/>
a darker faith. All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath<lb/>
me here; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things, exhaled<lb/>
as air, but water now.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the<lb/>
wild fowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the<lb/>
sea; though hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my<lb/>
foster-brothers!&#x201D;</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one,<lb/>
far to windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one<lb/>
astern. These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall;<lb/>
but the windward one could not be reached till morning; and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n588" n="551"/>
the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night; and that<lb/>
boat was Ahab&#x0027;s.</p>
<p>The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
spout-hole; and the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled<lb/>
flickering glare upon the black, glossy back, and far out upon<lb/>
the midnight waves, which gently chafed the whale&#x0027;s broad flank,<lb/>
like soft surf upon a beach.</p>
<p>Ahab and all his boat&#x0027;s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee;<lb/>
who crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spec-<lb/>
trally played round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks<lb/>
with their tails. A sound like the moaning in squadrons over<lb/>
Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering<lb/>
through the air.</p>
<p>Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee;<lb/>
and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the<lb/>
last men in a flooded world. &#x201C;I have dreamed it again,&#x201D;<lb/>
said he.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither<lb/>
hearse nor coffin can be thine?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And who are hearsed that die on the sea?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage,<lb/>
two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not<lb/>
made by mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must<lb/>
be grown in America.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:&#x2014;a hearse and its<lb/>
plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-<lb/>
bearers. Ha! Such a sight we shall not soon see.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And what was that saying about thyself?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy<lb/>
pilot.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And when thou art so gone before&#x2014;if that ever befall&#x2014;then<lb/>
ere I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me<lb/>
still?&#x2014;Was it not so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n589" n="552"/>
my pilot! I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Take another pledge, old man,&#x201D; said the Parsee, as his eyes<lb/>
lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom&#x2014;&#x201C;Hemp only can kill<lb/>
thee.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The gallows, ye mean.&#x2014;I am immortal then, on land and<lb/>
on sea,&#x201D; cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;&#x2014;&#x201C;Immortal on<lb/>
land and on sea!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came<lb/>
on, and the slumbering crew arose from the boat&#x0027;s bottom, and<lb/>
ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship.</p>

<head>CHAPTER CXVIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the quadrant</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> season for the Line at length drew near; and every day<lb/>
when Ahab, coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the<lb/>
vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and<lb/>
the eager mariners quickly run to the braces, and would stand<lb/>
there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon;<lb/>
impatient for the order to point the ship&#x0027;s prow for the equator.<lb/>
In good time the order came. It was hard upon high noon;<lb/>
and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was<lb/>
about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to deter-<lb/>
mine his latitude.</p>
<p>Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as fresh-<lb/>
ets of effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems<lb/>
the blazing focus of the glassy ocean&#x0027;s immeasurable burning-<lb/>
glass. The sky looks lacquered; clouds there are none; the<lb/>
horizon floats; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as<lb/>
the insufferable splendors of God&#x0027;s throne. Well that Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n590" n="553"/>
quadrant was furnished with colored glasses, through which to<lb/>
take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his seated form to<lb/>
the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking instrument<lb/>
placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some<lb/>
moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain<lb/>
its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was<lb/>
absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
deck, and with face thrown up like Ahab&#x0027;s, was eyeing the<lb/>
same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded their<lb/>
orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionless-<lb/>
ness. At length the desired observation was taken; and with<lb/>
his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his<lb/>
latitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling into a<lb/>
moment&#x0027;s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and mur-<lb/>
mured to himself: &#x201C;Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot!<lb/>
thou tellest me truly where I <hi rend="i">am</hi>&#x2014;but canst thou cast the least<lb/>
hint where I <hi rend="i">shall</hi> be? Or canst thou tell where some other<lb/>
thing besides me is this moment living? Where is Moby<lb/>
Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes of<lb/>
mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him;<lb/>
aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the<lb/>
objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the<lb/>
other, its numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again,<lb/>
and muttered: &#x201C;Foolish toy! babies&#x0027; plaything of haughty<lb/>
Admirals, and Commodores, and Captains; the world brags of<lb/>
thee, of thy cunning and might; but what after all canst thou<lb/>
do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where thou thyself happenest<lb/>
to be on this wide planet, and the hand that holds thee: no!<lb/>
not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of<lb/>
water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet<lb/>
with thy impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse<lb/>
thee, thou vain toy; and cursed be all the things that cast<lb/>
man&#x0027;s eyes aloft to that heaven, whose live vividness but<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n591" n="554"/>
scorches him, as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy<lb/>
light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth&#x0027;s horizon are the<lb/>
glances of man&#x0027;s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as<lb/>
if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee,<lb/>
thou quadrant!&#x201D; dashing it to the deck, &#x201C;no longer will I<lb/>
guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship&#x0027;s compass, and<lb/>
the level dead-reckoning, by log and by line; <hi rend="i">these</hi> shall con-<lb/>
duct me, and show me my place on the sea. Aye,&#x201D; lighting<lb/>
from the boat to the deck, &#x201C;thus I trample on thee, thou paltry<lb/>
thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and destroy<lb/>
thee!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with<lb/>
his live and dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant<lb/>
for Ahab, and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for him-<lb/>
self&#x2014;these passed over the mute, motionless Parsee&#x0027;s face. Un-<lb/>
observed he rose and glided away; while, awestruck by the<lb/>
aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered together on the<lb/>
forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck, shouted out&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;To the braces! Up helm!&#x2014;square in!&#x201D;</p>
<p>In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-<lb/>
wheeled upon her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts<lb/>
erectly poised upon her long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three<lb/>
Horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed.</p>
<p>Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the<lb/>
Pequod&#x0027;s tumultuous way, and Ahab&#x0027;s also, as he went lurching<lb/>
along the deck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all<lb/>
aglow, full of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane<lb/>
at last, down, down, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of<lb/>
all this fiery life of thine, what will at length remain but one<lb/>
little heap of ashes!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye,&#x201D; cried Stubb, &#x201C;but sea-coal ashes&#x2014;mind ye that, Mr.<lb/>
Starbuck&#x2014;sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I<lb/>
heard Ahab mutter, &#x2018;Here some one thrusts these cards into<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n592" n="555"/>
these old hands of mine; swears that I must play them, and no<lb/>
others.&#x2019; And damn me, Ahab, but thou actest right; live in<lb/>
the game, and die it!&#x201D;</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d119" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER CXIX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the candles</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Warmest</hi> climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of<lb/>
Bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies<lb/>
the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous<lb/>
Cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands.<lb/>
So, too, it is, that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mari-<lb/>
ner encounters the direst of all storms, the Typhoon. It will<lb/>
sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky, like an exploding<lb/>
bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.</p>
<p>Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her<lb/>
canvas, and bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had<lb/>
struck her directly ahead. When darkness came on, sky and<lb/>
sea roared and split with the thunder, and blazed with the<lb/>
lightning, that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and<lb/>
there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left<lb/>
for its after sport.</p>
<p>Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-<lb/>
deck; at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what<lb/>
additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper<lb/>
there; while Stubb and Flask were directing the men in the<lb/>
higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats. But all their<lb/>
pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very top of the<lb/>
cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab&#x0027;s) did not escape.<lb/>
A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
high tetering side, stove in the boat&#x0027;s bottom at the stern, and<lb/>
left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.</p>
<pb xml:id="n593" n="556"/>
<p>&#x201C;Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,&#x201D; said Stubb, regarding<lb/>
the wreck, &#x201C;but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can&#x0027;t<lb/>
fight it. You see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long<lb/>
start before it leaps, all round the world it runs, and then comes<lb/>
the spring! But as for me, all the start I have to meet it, is<lb/>
just across the deck here. But never mind; it&#x0027;s all in fun: so<lb/>
the old song says;&#x201D;&#x2014;(<hi rend="i">sings</hi>.)</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>Oh! jolly is the gale,</l>

<p>&#x201C;Avast Stubb,&#x201D; cried Starbuck, &#x201C;let the Typhoon sing, and<lb/>
strike his harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man<lb/>
thou wilt hold thy peace.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man;<lb/>
I am a coward; and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell<lb/>
you what it is, Mr. Starbuck, there&#x0027;s no way to stop my singing<lb/>
in this world but to cut my throat. And when that&#x0027;s done,<lb/>
ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a wind-up.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine<lb/>
own.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What! how can you see better of a dark night than any-<lb/>
body else, never mind how foolish?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Here!&#x201D; cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n594" n="557"/>
pointing his hand towards the weather bow, &#x201C;markest thou not<lb/>
that the gale comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab<lb/>
is to run for Moby Dick? the very course he swung to this day<lb/>
noon? now mark his boat there; where is that stove? In the<lb/>
stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand&#x2014;his stand-point is<lb/>
stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou must!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t half understand ye: what&#x0027;s in the wind?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way<lb/>
to Nantucket,&#x201D; soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of<lb/>
Stubb&#x0027;s question. &#x201C;The gale that now hammers at us to stave<lb/>
us, we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards<lb/>
home. Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom; but to<lb/>
leeward, homeward&#x2014;I see it lightens up there; but not with the<lb/>
lightning.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness,<lb/>
following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost<lb/>
at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who&#x0027;s there?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Old Thunder!&#x201D; said Ahab, groping his way along the<lb/>
bulwarks to his pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made<lb/>
plain to him by elbowed lances of fire.</p>
<p>Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to<lb/>
carry off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod<lb/>
which at sea some ships carry to each mast, is intended to con-<lb/>
duct it into the water. But as this conductor must descend to<lb/>
considerable depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the<lb/>
hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would<lb/>
be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with<lb/>
some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel&#x0027;s way<lb/>
in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally<lb/>
made in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled<lb/>
up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as<lb/>
occasion may require.</p>
<pb xml:id="n595" n="558"/>
<p>&#x201C;The rods! the rods!&#x201D; cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly<lb/>
admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just<lb/>
been darting flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. &#x201C;Are they<lb/>
overboard? drop them over, fore and aft. Quick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Avast!&#x201D; cried Ahab; &#x201C;let&#x0027;s have fair play here, though we<lb/>
be the weaker side. Yet I&#x0027;ll contribute to raise rods on the<lb/>
Himmalehs and Andes, that all the world may be secured; but<lb/>
out on privileges! Let them be, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look aloft!&#x201D; cried Starbuck. &#x201C;The corpusants! the cor-<lb/>
pusants!&#x201D;</p>
<p>All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched<lb/>
at each tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white<lb/>
flames, each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that<lb/>
sulphurous air, like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Blast the boat! let it go!&#x201D; cried Stubb at this instant, as a<lb/>
swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its<lb/>
gunwale violently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing.<lb/>
&#x201C;Blast it!&#x201D;&#x2014;but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted<lb/>
eyes caught the flames; and immediately shifting his tone, he<lb/>
cried&#x2014;&#x201C;The corpusants have mercy on us all!&#x201D;</p>
<p>To sailors&#x0027; oaths are household words; they will swear in the<lb/>
trance of the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will<lb/>
imprecate curses from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they<lb/>
teter over to a seething sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom<lb/>
have I heard a common oath when God&#x0027;s burning finger has<lb/>
been laid on the ship; when His &#x201C;Mene, Mene, Tekel Uphar-<lb/>
sin&#x201D; has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.</p>
<p>While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were<lb/>
heard from the enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood<lb/>
on the forecastle, all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphor-<lb/>
escence, like a far away constellation of stars. Relieved against<lb/>
the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to<lb/>
thrice his real stature, and seemed the black cloud from which<lb/>
the thunder had come. The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n596" n="559"/>
his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as if they too<lb/>
had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the preter-<lb/>
natural light, Queequeg&#x0027;s tattooing burned like Satanic blue<lb/>
flames on his body.</p>
<p>The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and<lb/>
once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were<lb/>
wrapped in a pall. A moment or two passed, when Starbuck,<lb/>
going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb. &#x201C;What<lb/>
thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same<lb/>
in the song.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, no, it wasn&#x0027;t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us<lb/>
all; and I hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy<lb/>
on long faces?&#x2014;have they no bowels for a laugh? And look<lb/>
ye, Mr. Starbuck&#x2014;but it&#x0027;s too dark too look. Hear me, then:<lb/>
I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for<lb/>
those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a&#x0027;<lb/>
block with sperm-oil, d&#x0027;ye see; and so, all that sperm will work<lb/>
up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will<lb/>
yet be as three spermaceti candles&#x2014;that&#x0027;s the good promise we<lb/>
saw.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb&#x0027;s face slowly<lb/>
beginning to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried:<lb/>
&#x201C;See! see!&#x201D; and once more the high tapering flames were<lb/>
beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their<lb/>
pallor.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The corpusants have mercy on us all,&#x201D; cried Stubb, again.</p>
<p>At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and<lb/>
the flame, the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab&#x0027;s front, but with his<lb/>
head bowed away from him; while near by, from the arched and<lb/>
overhanging rigging, where they had just been engaged secur-<lb/>
ing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare, now<lb/>
cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed<lb/>
wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted<lb/>
attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n597" n="560"/>
Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all their<lb/>
eyes upcast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, men!&#x201D; cried Ahab. &#x201C;Look up at it; mark it well;<lb/>
the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale!<lb/>
Hand me those main-mast links there; I would fain feel this<lb/>
pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against fire! So.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then turning&#x2014;the last link held fast in his left hand, he put<lb/>
his foot upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-<lb/>
flung right arm, he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed<lb/>
trinity of flames.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as<lb/>
Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned<lb/>
by thee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee,<lb/>
thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy right worship is<lb/>
defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and<lb/>
e&#x0027;en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed. No fear-<lb/>
less fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, placeless<lb/>
power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute<lb/>
its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of<lb/>
the personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though<lb/>
but a point at best; whencesoe&#x0027;er I came; wheresoe&#x0027;er I go;<lb/>
yet while I earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and<lb/>
feels her royal rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come<lb/>
in thy lowest form of love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but<lb/>
at thy highest, come as mere supernal power; and though thou<lb/>
launchest navies of full-freighted worlds, there&#x0027;s that in here that<lb/>
still remains indifferent. Oh, thou clear spirit, of thy fire thou<lb/>
madest me, and like a true child of fire, I breathe it back to thee.&#x201D;</p>
<p>[<hi rend="i">Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap<lb/>
lengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest,<lb/>
closes his eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them.</hi>]</p>
<p>&#x201C;I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor<lb/>
was it wrung from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n598" n="561"/>
canst blind; but I can then grope. Thou canst consume; but<lb/>
I can then be ashes. Take the homage of these poor eyes, and<lb/>
shutter-hands. I would not take it. The lightning flashes<lb/>
through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my whole<lb/>
beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning<lb/>
ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light<lb/>
though thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am dark-<lb/>
ness leaping out of light, leaping out of thee! The javelins<lb/>
cease; open eyes; see, or not? There burn the flames! Oh,<lb/>
thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my genealogy. But<lb/>
thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not.<lb/>
Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my<lb/>
puzzle; but thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye,<lb/>
hence callest thyself unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy<lb/>
beginning, hence callest thyself unbegun. I know that of me,<lb/>
which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou omnipotent. There<lb/>
is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear spirit, to whom<lb/>
all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness mechanical.<lb/>
Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see<lb/>
it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too<lb/>
hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here<lb/>
again with haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and<lb/>
lick the sky! I leap with thee; I burn with thee; would fain<lb/>
be welded with thee; defyingly I worship thee!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The boat! the boat!&#x201D; cried Starbuck, &#x201C;look at thy boat,<lb/>
old man!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ahab&#x0027;s harpoon, the one forged at Perth&#x0027;s fire, remained<lb/>
firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected<lb/>
beyond his whale-boat&#x0027;s bow; but the sea that had stove its<lb/>
bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off; and<lb/>
from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of<lb/>
pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there like a<lb/>
serpent&#x0027;s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm&#x2014;&#x201C;God,<lb/>
God is against thee, old man; forbear! t&#x0027; is an ill voyage! ill<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n599" n="562"/>
begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may,<lb/>
old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a bet-<lb/>
ter voyage than this.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran<lb/>
to the braces&#x2014;though not a sail was left aloft. For the<lb/>
moment all the aghast mate&#x0027;s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised<lb/>
a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling lightning links to<lb/>
the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it<lb/>
like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first<lb/>
sailor that but cast loose a rope&#x0027;s end. Petrified by his aspect,<lb/>
and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the<lb/>
men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as<lb/>
mine; and heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is<lb/>
bound. And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats;<lb/>
look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!&#x201D; And with one<lb/>
blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.</p>
<p>As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neigh-<lb/>
borhood of some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and<lb/>
strength but render it so much the more unsafe, because so<lb/>
much the more a mark for thunderbolts; so at those last words<lb/>
of Ahab&#x0027;s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror<lb/>
of dismay.</p>

<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="sc">No</hi>, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as<lb/>
you please, but you will never pound into me what you were<lb/>
just now saying. And how long ago is it since you said the<lb/>
very contrary? Didn&#x0027;t you once say that whatever ship Ahab<lb/>
sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance<lb/>
policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft<lb/>
and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn&#x0027;t you say<lb/>
so?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, suppose I did? What then? I&#x0027;ve part changed my<lb/>
flesh since that time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing<lb/>
we <hi rend="i">are</hi> loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward;</p>
<pb xml:id="n601" n="564"/>
<p>how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray<lb/>
here? Why, my little man, you have pretty red hair, but you<lb/>
couldn&#x0027;t get afire now. Shake yourself; you&#x0027;re Aquarius, or<lb/>
the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat collar.<lb/>
Don&#x0027;t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine In-<lb/>
surance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants,<lb/>
Flask. But hark, again, and I&#x0027;ll answer ye the other thing.<lb/>
First take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though,<lb/>
so I can pass the rope; now listen. What&#x0027;s the mighty differ-<lb/>
ence between holding a mast&#x0027;s lightning-rod in the storm, and<lb/>
standing close by a mast that hasn&#x0027;t got any lightning-rod at<lb/>
all in a storm? Don&#x0027;t you see, you timber-head, that no harm<lb/>
can come to theh older of the rod, unless the mast is first struck?<lb/>
What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in a hundred<lb/>
carries rods, and Ahab,&#x2014;aye, man, and all of us,&#x2014;were in no<lb/>
more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten<lb/>
thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you,<lb/>
I suppose you would have every man in the world go about<lb/>
with a small lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat,<lb/>
like a militia officer&#x0027;s skewered feather, and trailing behind like<lb/>
his sash. Why don&#x0027;t ye be sensible, Flask? it&#x0027;s easy to be sensi-<lb/>
ble; why don&#x0027;t ye, then? any man with half an eye can be<lb/>
sensible.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather<lb/>
hard.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes, when a fellow&#x0027;s soaked through, it&#x0027;s hard to be sensi-<lb/>
ble, that&#x0027;s a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray.<lb/>
Never mind; catch the turn there, and pass it. Seems to me<lb/>
we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never<lb/>
going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here, Flask,<lb/>
seems like tying a man&#x0027;s hands behind him. And what big<lb/>
generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron fists,<lb/>
hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether<lb/>
the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n602" n="565"/>
uncommon long cable, though. There, hammer that knot<lb/>
down, and we&#x0027;ve done. So; next to touching land, lighting on<lb/>
deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just wring out my jacket<lb/>
skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so, Flask;<lb/>
but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all<lb/>
storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry<lb/>
off the water, d&#x0027;ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form<lb/>
gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and<lb/>
tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down<lb/>
a beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin over-<lb/>
board; Lord, Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should<lb/>
be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night, lad.&#x201D;</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">During</hi> the most violent-shocks of the Typhoon, the man at<lb/>
the Pequod&#x0027;s jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly<lb/>
hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions, even though pre-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n603" n="566"/>
venter tackles had been attached to it&#x2014;for they were slack&#x2014;<lb/>
because some play to the tiller was indispensable.</p>
<p>In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttle-<lb/>
cock to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles<lb/>
in the compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was<lb/>
thus with the Pequod&#x0027;s; at almost every shock the helmsman<lb/>
had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they<lb/>
revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly any one can<lb/>
behold without some sort of unwonted emotion.</p>
<p>Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that<lb/>
through the strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb&#x2014;one<lb/>
engaged forward and the other aft&#x2014;the shivered remnants of<lb/>
the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut adrift from the spars,<lb/>
and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of an alba-<lb/>
tross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-<lb/>
tossed bird is on the wing.</p>
<p>The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed,<lb/>
and a storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon<lb/>
went through the water with some precision again; and the<lb/>
course&#x2014;for the present, East-south-east&#x2014;which he was to steer,<lb/>
if practicable, was once more given to the helmsman. For<lb/>
during the violence of the gale, he had only steered according<lb/>
to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the ship as<lb/>
near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile,<lb/>
lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye,<lb/>
the foul breeze became fair!</p>
<p>Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of &#x201C;<hi rend="i">Ho!<lb/>
the fair wind! oh-he-yo, cheerly, men!</hi>&#x201D; the crew singing for<lb/>
joy, that so promising an event should so soon have falsified<lb/>
the evil portents preceding it.</p>
<p>In compliance with the standing order of his commander&#x2014;<lb/>
to report immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours,<lb/>
any decided change in the affairs of the deck,&#x2014;Starbuck had<lb/>
no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze&#x2014;however reluctantly<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n604" n="567"/>
and gloomily,&#x2014;than he mechanically went below to apprise<lb/>
Captain Ahab of the circumstance.</p>
<p>Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused<lb/>
before it a moment. The cabin lamp&#x2014;taking long swings this<lb/>
way and that&#x2014;was burning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows<lb/>
upon the old man&#x0027;s bolted door,&#x2014;a thin one, with fixed blinds<lb/>
inserted, in place of upper panels. The isolated subterraneousness<lb/>
of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there,<lb/>
though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements.<lb/>
The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as<lb/>
they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck<lb/>
was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck&#x0027;s heart,<lb/>
at that instant when he saw the muskets, there strangely<lb/>
evolved an evil thought; but so blent with its neutral or<lb/>
good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for<lb/>
itself.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He would have shot me once,&#x201D; he murmured, &#x201C;yes, there&#x0027;s<lb/>
the very musket that he pointed at me;&#x2014;that one with the stud-<lb/>
ded stock; let me touch it&#x2014;lift it. Strange, that I, who have han-<lb/>
dled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now.<lb/>
Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;&#x2014;that&#x0027;s<lb/>
not good. Best spill it?&#x2014;wait. I&#x0027;ll cure myself of this. I&#x0027;ll hold<lb/>
the musket boldly while I think.&#x2014;I come to report a fair wind<lb/>
to him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom,&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that&#x0027;s</hi> fair<lb/>
for Moby Dick. It&#x0027;s a fair wind that&#x0027;s only fair for that<lb/>
accursed fish.&#x2014;The very tube he pointed at me!&#x2014;the very<lb/>
one; <hi rend="i">this</hi> one&#x2014;I hold it here; he would have killed me<lb/>
with the very thing I handle now.&#x2014;Aye and he would fain<lb/>
kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike his spars<lb/>
to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and<lb/>
in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere<lb/>
dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very<lb/>
Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-<lb/>
rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n605" n="568"/>
to drag a whole ship&#x0027;s company down to doom with him?<lb/>
&#x2014;Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty<lb/>
men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come<lb/>
to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his<lb/>
way. If, then, he were this instant&#x2014;put aside, that crime would<lb/>
not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,<lb/>
&#x2014;in there, he&#x0027;s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and<lb/>
soon awake again. I can&#x0027;t withstand thee, then, old man.<lb/>
Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou<lb/>
hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own<lb/>
flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say&#x0027;st the<lb/>
men have vow&#x0027;d thy vow; say&#x0027;st all of us are Ahabs. Great<lb/>
God forbid!&#x2014;But is there no other way? no lawful way?&#x2014;<lb/>
Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest<lb/>
this old man&#x0027;s living power from his own living hands? Only<lb/>
a fool would try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all<lb/>
over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on<lb/>
this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger,<lb/>
then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his<lb/>
howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would<lb/>
leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains?<lb/>
The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the<lb/>
nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans<lb/>
and a whole continent between me and law.&#x2014;Aye, aye, &#x0027;tis so.<lb/>
&#x2014;Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be<lb/>
murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin together?&#x2014;And<lb/>
would I be a murderer, then, if&#x201D;&#x2014;and slowly, stealthily,<lb/>
and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket&#x0027;s end<lb/>
against the door.</p>
<p>&#x201C;On this level, Ahab&#x0027;s hammock swings within; his head<lb/>
this way. A touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife<lb/>
and child again.&#x2014;Oh Mary! Mary!&#x2014;boy! boy! boy!&#x2014;But<lb/>
if I wake thee not to death, old man, who can tell to what<lb/>
unsounded deeps Starbuck&#x0027;s body this day week may sink, with<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n606" n="569"/>
all the crew! Great God, where art thou? Shall<lb/>
I? shall I? &#x2014; The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the<lb/>
fore and main topsails are reefed and set; she heads her<lb/>
course.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the<lb/>
old man&#x0027;s tormented sleep, as if Starbuck&#x0027;s voice had caused the<lb/>
long dumb dream to speak.</p>
<p>The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard&#x0027;s arm against<lb/>
the panel; Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turn-<lb/>
ing from the door, he placed the death-tube in its rack, and left<lb/>
the place.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and<lb/>
wake him, and tell him. I must see to the deck here. Thou<lb/>
know&#x0027;st what to say.&#x201D;</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Next</hi> morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow<lb/>
billows of mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod&#x0027;s gurgling<lb/>
track, pushed her on like giants&#x0027; palms outspread. The strong,<lb/>
unstaggering breeze abounded so, that sky and air seemed vast<lb/>
outbellying sails; the whole world boomed before the wind.<lb/>
Muffled in the full morning light, the invisible sun was only<lb/>
known by the spread intensity of his place; where his bayonet<lb/>
rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned Baby-<lb/>
lonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was<lb/>
as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light<lb/>
and heat.</p>
<p>Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart;<lb/>
and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n607" n="570"/>
bowsprit, he turned to eye the bright sun&#x0027;s rays produced<lb/>
ahead; and when she profoundly settled by the stern, he<lb/>
turned behind, and saw the sun&#x0027;s rearward place, and how the<lb/>
same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the<lb/>
sea-chariot of the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow,<lb/>
I bring the sun to ye! Yoke on the further billows; hallo!<lb/>
a tandem, I drive the sea!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hur-<lb/>
ried towards the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was<lb/>
heading.</p>
<p>&#x201C;East-sou-east, sir,&#x201D; said the frightened steersman.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou liest!&#x201D; smiting him with his clenched fist. &#x201C;Heading<lb/>
East at this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon<lb/>
just then observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every<lb/>
one else; but its very blinding palpableness must have been<lb/>
the cause.</p>
<p>Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught<lb/>
one glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for<lb/>
a moment he almost seemed to stagger. Standing behind him<lb/>
Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses pointed East, and<lb/>
the Pequod was as infallibly going West.</p>
<p>But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the<lb/>
crew, the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, &#x201C;I have it!<lb/>
It has happened before. Mr. Starbuck, last night&#x0027;s thunder<lb/>
turned our compasses&#x2014;that&#x0027;s all. Thou hast before now heard<lb/>
of such a thing, I take it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,&#x201D; said<lb/>
the pale mate, gloomily.</p>
<p>Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in<lb/>
more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The<lb/>
magnetic energy, as developed in the mariner&#x0027;s needle, is, as all<lb/>
know, essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven;</p>
<pb xml:id="n608" n="571"/>
<p>hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things should<lb/>
be. In instances where the lightning has actually struck the<lb/>
vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the<lb/>
effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal; all its<lb/>
loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic<lb/>
steel was of no more use than an old wife&#x0027;s knitting needle.<lb/>
But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the<lb/>
original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle com-<lb/>
passes be affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may<lb/>
be in the ship; even were the lowermost one inserted into the<lb/>
kelson.</p>
<p>Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the<lb/>
transpointed compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his<lb/>
extended hand, now took the precise bearing of the sun, and<lb/>
satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted, shouted out his<lb/>
orders for the ship&#x0027;s course to be changed accordingly. The<lb/>
yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her<lb/>
undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed<lb/>
fair one had only been juggling her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck<lb/>
said nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while<lb/>
Stubb and Flask&#x2014;who in some small degree seemed then to<lb/>
be sharing his feelings&#x2014;likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As<lb/>
for the men, though some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of<lb/>
Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as ever before,<lb/>
the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed;<lb/>
or if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into<lb/>
their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab&#x0027;s.</p>
<p>For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries.<lb/>
But chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed<lb/>
copper sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before<lb/>
dashed to the deck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun&#x0027;s pilot! yesterday<lb/>
I wrecked thee, and to-day the compasses would feign have<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n609" n="572"/>
wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is lord over the level load-<lb/>
stone yet. Mr. Starbuck&#x2014;a lance without the pole; a top-<lb/>
maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker&#x0027;s needles. Quick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was<lb/>
now about to do, were certain prudential motives, whose ob-<lb/>
ject might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a<lb/>
stroke of his subtile skill, in a matter so wondrous as that of<lb/>
the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man well knew that<lb/>
to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily practicable,<lb/>
was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors, with-<lb/>
out some shudderings and evil portents.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Men,&#x201D; said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate<lb/>
handed him the things he had demanded, &#x201C;my men, the<lb/>
thunder turned old Ahab&#x0027;s needles; but out of this bit of<lb/>
steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point as true as<lb/>
any.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by<lb/>
the sailors, as this was said; and with fascinated eyes they<lb/>
awaited whatever magic might follow. But Starbuck looked<lb/>
away.</p>
<p>With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel<lb/>
head of the lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron<lb/>
rod remaining, bade him hold it upright, without its touching<lb/>
the deck. Then, with the maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper<lb/>
end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the<lb/>
top of it, and less strongly hammered that, several times, the<lb/>
mate still holding the rod as before. Then going through some<lb/>
small strange motions with it&#x2014;whether indispensable to the<lb/>
magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the<lb/>
awe of the crew, is uncertain&#x2014;he called for linen thread; and<lb/>
moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles<lb/>
there, and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle,<lb/>
over one of the compass-cards. At first, the steel went round<lb/>
and round, quivering and vibrating at either end; but at last<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n610" n="573"/>
it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been intently<lb/>
watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle,<lb/>
and pointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,&#x2014;&#x201C;Look<lb/>
ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level load-<lb/>
stone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!&#x201D;</p>
<p>One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own<lb/>
eyes could persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after<lb/>
another they slunk away.</p>
<p>In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab<lb/>
in all his fatal pride.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">While</hi> now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this<lb/>
voyage, the log and line had but very seldom been in use.<lb/>
Owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining<lb/>
the vessel&#x0027;s place, some merchantmen, and many whalemen,<lb/>
especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log;<lb/>
though at the same time, and frequently more for form&#x0027;s sake<lb/>
than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary<lb/>
slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed<lb/>
average rate of progression every hour. It had been thus with<lb/>
the Pequod. The wooden reel and angular log attached hung,<lb/>
long untouched, just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks.<lb/>
Rains and spray had damped it; sun and wind had warped it;<lb/>
all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly.<lb/>
But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened<lb/>
to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet<lb/>
scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and<lb/>
recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line. The<lb/>

grizzly Manxman. &#x201C;Take the reel, one of ye, I&#x0027;ll heave.&#x201D;</p>
<p>They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship&#x0027;s lee side,<lb/>
where the deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now<lb/>
almost dipping into the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.</p>
<p>The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the<lb/>
projecting handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool<lb/>
of line revolved, so stood with the angular log hanging down-<lb/>
wards, till Ahab advanced to him.</p>
<p>Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some<lb/>
thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss<lb/>
overboard, when the old Manxman, who was intently eyeing<lb/>
both him and the line, made bold to speak.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and<lb/>
wet have spoiled it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x0027;Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they<lb/>
spoiled thee? Thou seem&#x0027;st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life<lb/>
holds thee; not thou it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With<lb/>
these grey hairs of mine &#x0027;tis not worth while disputing,<lb/>
&#x0027;specially with a superior, who&#x0027;ll ne&#x0027;er confess.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s that? There now&#x0027;s a patched professor in Queen<lb/>
Nature&#x0027;s granite-founded College; but methinks he&#x0027;s too sub-<lb/>
servient. Where wert thou born?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Excellent! Thou&#x0027;st hit the world by that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I know not, sir, but I was born there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it&#x0027;s good.<lb/>
Here&#x0027;s a man from Man; a man born in once independent<lb/>
Man, and now unmanned of Man; which is sucked in&#x2014;by<lb/>
what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall butts all<lb/>
inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n612" n="575"/>
out in a long dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel<lb/>
began to whirl. In turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the<lb/>
rolling billows, the towing resistance of the log caused the old<lb/>
reelman to stagger strangely.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hold hard!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long<lb/>
festoon; the tugging log was gone.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and<lb/>
now the mad sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all.<lb/>
Haul in here, Tahitian; reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let<lb/>
the carpenter make another log, and mend thou the line. See<lb/>
to it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There he goes now; to him nothing&#x0027;s happened; but to<lb/>
me, the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world.<lb/>
Haul in, haul in, Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling<lb/>
out: come in broken, and dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to<lb/>
help; eh, Pip?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-<lb/>
boat. Pip&#x0027;s missing. Let&#x0027;s see now if ye haven&#x0027;t fished him<lb/>
up here, fisherman. It drags hard; I guess he&#x0027;s holding on.<lb/>
Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul in no cowards here.<lb/>
Ho! there&#x0027;s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a<lb/>
hatchet! cut it off&#x2014;we haul in no cowards here. Captain<lb/>
Ahab! sir, sir! here&#x0027;s Pip, trying to get on board again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Peace, thou crazy loon,&#x201D; cried the Manxman, seizing him<lb/>
by the arm. &#x201C;Away from the quarter-deck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,&#x201D; muttered Ahab,<lb/>
advancing. &#x201C;Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest<lb/>
thou Pip was, boy?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Astern there, sir, astern! Lo, lo!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the<lb/>
vacant pupils of thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a<lb/>
thing for immortal souls to sieve through! Who art thou,<lb/>
boy?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n613" n="576"/>
<p>&#x201C;Bell-boy, sir; ship&#x0027;s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip!<lb/>
Pip! One hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet<lb/>
high&#x2014;looks cowardly&#x2014;quickest known by that! Ding, dong,<lb/>
ding! Who&#x0027;s seen Pip the coward?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen<lb/>
heavens! look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child,<lb/>
and have abandoned him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy;<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s cabin shall be Pip&#x0027;s home henceforth, while Ahab lives.<lb/>
Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by<lb/>
cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let&#x0027;s down.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s this? here&#x0027;s velvet shark-skin,&#x201D; intenting gazing at<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s hand, and feeling it. &#x201C;Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt<lb/>
so kind a thing as this, perhaps he had ne&#x0027;er been lost! This<lb/>
seems to me, sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls<lb/>
may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and rivet<lb/>
these two hands together; the black one with the white, for<lb/>
I will not let this go.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee<lb/>
to worse horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin.<lb/>
Lo! ye believers in gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo<lb/>
you! see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man; and<lb/>
man, though idiotic, and knowing not what he does, yet full of<lb/>
the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come! I feel prouder<lb/>
leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an<lb/>
Emperor&#x0027;s!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There go two daft ones now,&#x201D; muttered the old Manxman.<lb/>
&#x201C;One daft with strength, the other daft with weakness. But<lb/>
here&#x0027;s the end of the rotten line&#x2014;all dripping, too. Mend it,<lb/>
eh? I think we had best have a new line altogether. I&#x0027;ll see<lb/>
Mr. Stubb about it.&#x201D;</p>

<hi rend="sc">the life-buoy</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Steering</hi> now south-eastward by Ahab&#x0027;s levelled steel, and<lb/>
her progress solely determined by Ahab&#x0027;s level log and line; the<lb/>
Pequod held on her path towards the Equator. Making so long<lb/>
a passage through such unfrequented waters, descrying no ships,<lb/>
and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds, over<lb/>
waves monotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm<lb/>
things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.</p>
<p>At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were,<lb/>
of the Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that<lb/>
goes before the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets;<lb/>
the watch&#x2014;then headed by Flask&#x2014;was startled by a cry so<lb/>
plaintively wild and unearthly&#x2014;like half-articulated wailings of<lb/>
the ghosts of all Herod&#x0027;s murdered Innocents&#x2014;that one and<lb/>
all, they started from their reveries, and for the space of some<lb/>
moments stood, or sat, or leaned all transfixedly listening, like<lb/>
the carved Roman slave, while that wild cry remained within<lb/>
hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew said it<lb/>
was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers<lb/>
remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman&#x2014;the oldest<lb/>
mariner of all&#x2014;declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were<lb/>
heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea.</p>
<p>Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey<lb/>
dawn, when he came to the deck; it was then recounted to him<lb/>
by Flask, not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He<lb/>
hollowly laughed, and thus explained the wonder.</p>
<p>Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of<lb/>
great numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n615" n="578"/>
dams, or some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen<lb/>
nigh the ship and kept company with her, crying and sobbing<lb/>
with their human sort of wail. But this only the more affected<lb/>
some of them, because most mariners cherish a very superstitious<lb/>
feeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar tones<lb/>
when in distress, but also from the human look of their round<lb/>
heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the<lb/>
water alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals<lb/>
have more than once been mistaken for men.</p>
<p>But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most<lb/>
plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that<lb/>
morning. At sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his<lb/>
mast-head at the fore; and whether it was that he was not yet<lb/>
half waked from his sleep (for sailors sometimes go aloft in<lb/>
a transition state), whether it was thus with the man, there is<lb/>
now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had not been long at<lb/>
his perch, when a cry was heard&#x2014;a cry and a rushing&#x2014;and<lb/>
looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and looking<lb/>
down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the<lb/>
sea.</p>
<p>The life-buoy&#x2014;a long slender cask&#x2014;was dropped from the<lb/>
stern, where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but<lb/>
no hand rose to seize it, and the sun having long beat upon this<lb/>
cask it had shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and the parched<lb/>
wood also filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound<lb/>
cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his<lb/>
pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.</p>
<p>And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast<lb/>
to look out for the White Whale, on the White Whale&#x0027;s own<lb/>
peculiar ground; that man was swallowed up in the deep. But<lb/>
few, perhaps, thought of that at the time. Indeed, in some<lb/>
sort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent;<lb/>
for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future,<lb/>
but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They de-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n616" n="579"/>
clared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they<lb/>
had heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said<lb/>
nay.</p>
<p>The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was<lb/>
directed to see to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could<lb/>
be found, and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed<lb/>
the approaching crisis of the voyage, all hands were impatient<lb/>
of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end,<lb/>
whatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going to<lb/>
leave the ship&#x0027;s stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain<lb/>
strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concern-<lb/>
ing his coffin.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A life-buoy of a coffin!&#x201D; cried Starbuck, starting.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Rather queer, that, I should say,&#x201D; said Stubb.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It will make a good enough one,&#x201D; said Flask, &#x201C;the carpenter<lb/>
here can arrange it easily.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bring it up; there&#x0027;s nothing else for it,&#x201D; said Starbuck,<lb/>
after a melancholy pause. &#x201C;Rig it, carpenter; do not look at<lb/>
me so&#x2014;the coffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And shall I nail down the lid, sir?&#x201D; moving his hand as with<lb/>
a hammer.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And shall I caulk the seams, sir?&#x201D; moving his hand as with a<lb/>
caulking-iron.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?&#x201D; mov-<lb/>
ing his hand as with a pitch-pot.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of<lb/>
the coffin, and no more.&#x2014;Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward<lb/>
with me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the<lb/>
parts he baulks. Now I don&#x0027;t like this. I make a leg for Cap-<lb/>
tain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a<lb/>
bandbox for Queequeg, and he wont put his head into it. Are<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n617" n="580"/>
all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I&#x0027;m<lb/>
ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It&#x0027;s like turning an old coat;<lb/>
going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I don&#x0027;t like<lb/>
this cobbling sort of business&#x2014;I don&#x0027;t like it at all; its undigni-<lb/>
fied; it&#x0027;s not my place. Let tinkers&#x0027; brats do tinkerings; we<lb/>
are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,<lb/>
fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly be-<lb/>
gins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and<lb/>
comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler&#x0027;s job, that&#x0027;s<lb/>
at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It&#x0027;s<lb/>
the old woman&#x0027;s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what<lb/>
an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old<lb/>
woman of sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young<lb/>
tinker once. And that&#x0027;s the reason I never would work for<lb/>
lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in<lb/>
the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old<lb/>
heads to run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at<lb/>
sea but snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; caulk<lb/>
the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down<lb/>
tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship&#x0027;s stern.<lb/>
Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some super-<lb/>
stitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging,<lb/>
ere they would do the job. But I&#x0027;m made of knotty Aroostook<lb/>
hemlock; I don&#x0027;t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing<lb/>
about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers<lb/>
in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as<lb/>
coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or<lb/>
by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our<lb/>
work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it<lb/>
if we can. Hem! I&#x0027;ll do the job, now, tenderly. I&#x0027;ll have me<lb/>
&#x2014;let&#x0027;s see&#x2014;how many in the ship&#x0027;s company, all told? But<lb/>
I&#x0027;ve forgotten. Any way, I&#x0027;ll have me thirty separate, Turk&#x0027;s-<lb/>
headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the<lb/>
coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there&#x0027;ll be thirty lively fel-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n618" n="581"/>
lows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often<lb/>
beneath the sun! Come hammer, calking-iron, pitch-pot, and<lb/>
marling-spike! Let&#x0027;s to it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck&#x0027;s orders. Oh, look, sir! Be-<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump<lb/>
come from thy shop?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Quee-<lb/>
queg; but they&#x0027;ve set me now to turning it into something<lb/>
else.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, inter-<lb/>
meddling, monopolizing, heathenish old scamp, to be one day<lb/>
making legs, and the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet<lb/>
again life-buoys out of those same coffins? Thou art as un-<lb/>
principled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n619" n="582"/>
<p>&#x201C;But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working<lb/>
about a coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when<lb/>
chipping out the craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in<lb/>
the play sings, spade in hand. Dost thou never?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I&#x0027;m indifferent enough, sir,<lb/>
for that; but the reason why the grave-digger made music<lb/>
must have been because there was none in his spade, sir. But<lb/>
the calking mallet is full of it. Hark to it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, and that&#x0027;s because the lid there&#x0027;s a sounding-board;<lb/>
and what in all things makes the sounding-board is this&#x2014;<lb/>
there&#x0027;s naught beneath. And yet, a coffin with a body in it<lb/>
rings pretty much the same, Carpenter. Hast thou ever helped<lb/>
carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against the church-<lb/>
yard gate, going in?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Faith, sir, I&#x0027;ve&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Faith? What&#x0027;s that?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, faith, sir, it&#x0027;s only a sort of exclamation-like&#x2014;that&#x0027;s<lb/>
all, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Um, um; go on.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was about to say, sir, that&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud<lb/>
out of thyself? Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get<lb/>
these traps out of sight.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come<lb/>
sudden in hot latitudes. I&#x0027;ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle,<lb/>
one of the Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle.<lb/>
Seems to me some sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right<lb/>
in his middle. He&#x0027;s always under the Line&#x2014;fiery hot, I tell ye!<lb/>
He&#x0027;s looking this way&#x2014;come, oakum; quick. Here we go<lb/>
again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I&#x0027;m the professor<lb/>
of musical glasses&#x2014;tap, tap!&#x201D;</p>
<p>(<hi rend="i">Ahab to himself</hi>.)</p>
<p>&#x201C;There&#x0027;s a sight! There&#x0027;s a sound! The greyheaded wood-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n620" n="583"/>
pecker tapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well<lb/>
be envied now. See! that thing rests on two line-tubs, full of<lb/>
tow-lines. A most malicious wag, that fellow. Rat-tat! So<lb/>
man&#x0027;s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all materials!<lb/>
What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here<lb/>
now&#x0027;s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap,<lb/>
made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most<lb/>
endangered life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further?<lb/>
Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but<lb/>
an immortality-preserver! I&#x0027;ll think of that. But no. So far<lb/>
gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the<lb/>
theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will<lb/>
ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I<lb/>
go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again.<lb/>
Now, then, Pip, we&#x0027;ll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous<lb/>

<hi rend="sc">the pequod meets the rachel</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Next</hi> day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing<lb/>
directly down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering<lb/>
with men. At the time the Pequod was making good speed<lb/>
through the water; but as the broad-winged windward stranger<lb/>
shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank<lb/>
bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bad news; she brings bad news,&#x201D; muttered the old Manx-<lb/>
man. But ere her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth,<lb/>
stood up in his boat; ere he could hopefully hail, Ahab&#x0027;s voice<lb/>
was heard.</p>
<pb xml:id="n621" n="584"/>
<p>&#x201C;Hast seen the White Whale?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected<lb/>
question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when<lb/>
the stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel&#x0027;s way,<lb/>
was seen descending her side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-<lb/>
hook soon clinched the Pequod&#x0027;s main-chains, and he sprang<lb/>
to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a<lb/>
Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Where was he?&#x2014;not killed!&#x2014;not killed!&#x201D; cried Ahab,<lb/>
closely advancing. &#x201C;How was it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day<lb/>
previous, while three of the stranger&#x0027;s boats were engaged with<lb/>
a shoal of whales, which had led them some four or five miles<lb/>
from the ship; and while they were yet in swift chase to wind-<lb/>
ward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly<lb/>
loomed up out of the blue water, not very far to leeward;<lb/>
whereupon, the fourth rigged boat&#x2014;a reserved one&#x2014;had been<lb/>
instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind,<lb/>
this fourth boat&#x2014;the swiftest keeled of all&#x2014;seemed to have<lb/>
succeeded in fastening&#x2014;at least, as well as the man at the mast-<lb/>
head could tell anything about it. In the distance he saw the<lb/>
diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling<lb/>
white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was con-<lb/>
cluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away<lb/>
with his pursuers, as often happens. There was some appre-<lb/>
hension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals were<lb/>
placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up<lb/>
her three far to windward boats&#x2014;ere going in quest of the<lb/>
fourth one in the precisely opposite direction&#x2014;the ship had not<lb/>
only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near<lb/>
midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from it.<lb/>
But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded<lb/>
all sail&#x2014;stunsail on stunsail&#x2014;after the missing boat; kindling a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n622" n="585"/>
fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on<lb/>
the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient<lb/>
distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when<lb/>
last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to<lb/>
pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again<lb/>
dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though<lb/>
she had thus continued doing till day light; yet not the least<lb/>
glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.</p>
<p>The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to<lb/>
reveal his object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship<lb/>
to unite with his own in the search; by sailing over the sea<lb/>
some four or five miles apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping<lb/>
a double horizon, as it were.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I will wager something now,&#x201D; whispered Stubb to Flask,<lb/>
&#x201C;that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captain&#x0027;s<lb/>
best coat; mayhap, his watch&#x2014;he&#x0027;s so cursed anxious to get it<lb/>
back. Who ever heard of two pious whale-ships cruising after<lb/>
one missing whale-boat in the height of the whaling season?<lb/>
See, Flask, only see how pale he looks&#x2014;pale in the very but-<lb/>
tons of his eyes&#x2014;look&#x2014;it wasn&#x0027;t the coat&#x2014;it must have been<lb/>
the&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;My boy, my own boy is among them. For God&#x0027;s sake&#x2014;I<lb/>
beg, I conjure&#x201D;&#x2014;here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab,<lb/>
who thus far had but icily received his petition. &#x201C;For eight-<lb/>
and-forty hours let me charter your ship&#x2014;I will gladly pay for<lb/>
it, and roundly pay for it&#x2014;if there be no other way&#x2014;for eight-<lb/>
and-forty hours only&#x2014;only that&#x2014;you must, oh, you must, and<lb/>
you <hi rend="i">shall</hi> do this thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;His son!&#x201D; cried Stubb, &#x201C;oh, it&#x0027;s his son he&#x0027;s lost! I take<lb/>
back the coat and watch&#x2014;what says Ahab? We must save<lb/>
that boy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;s drowned with the rest on &#x0027;em, last night,&#x201D; said the old<lb/>
Manx sailor standing behind them; &#x201C;I heard; all of ye heard<lb/>
their spirits.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n623" n="586"/>
<p>Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of<lb/>
the Rachel&#x0027;s the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that<lb/>
not only was one of the Captain&#x0027;s sons among the number of<lb/>
the missing boat&#x0027;s crew; but among the number of the other<lb/>
boat&#x0027;s crews, at the same time, but on the other hand, separated<lb/>
from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase, there had<lb/>
been still another son; as that for a time, the wretched father<lb/>
was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity; which<lb/>
was only solved for him by his chief mate&#x0027;s instinctively adopt-<lb/>
ing the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,<lb/>
that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats,<lb/>
always to pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some<lb/>
unknown constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning<lb/>
all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab&#x0027;s iciness did he allude<lb/>
to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old,<lb/>
whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a<lb/>
Nantucketer&#x0027;s paternal love, had thus early sought to initiate<lb/>
him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially<lb/>
the destiny of all his race. Nor does it unfrequently occur, that<lb/>
Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away<lb/>
from them, for a protracted three or four years&#x0027; voyage in some<lb/>
other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a<lb/>
whaleman&#x0027;s career shall be unenervated by any chance display<lb/>
of a father&#x0027;s natural but untimely partiality, or undue appre-<lb/>
hensiveness and concern.</p>
<p>Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon<lb/>
of Ahab; and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every<lb/>
shock, but without the least quivering of his own.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I will not go,&#x201D; said the stranger, &#x201C;till you say <hi rend="i">aye</hi> to me.<lb/>
Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case.<lb/>
For <hi rend="i">you</hi> too have a boy, Captain Ahab&#x2014;though but a child, and nestling safely at home now&#x2014;a child<lb/>
of your old age too&#x2014;<lb/>
Yes, yes, you relent; I see it&#x2014;run, run, men, now, and stand by<lb/>
to square in the yards.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n624" n="587"/>
<p>&#x201C;Avast,&#x201D; cried Ahab&#x2014;&#x201C;touch not a rope-yarn;&#x201D; then in a<lb/>
voice that prolongingly moulded every word&#x2014;&#x201C;Captain Gardi-<lb/>
ner, I will not do it. Even now I lose time. Good bye, good<lb/>
bye. God bless ye, man, and may I forgive myself, but I must<lb/>
go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle watch, and in three<lb/>
minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers: then<lb/>
brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his<lb/>
cabin, leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional<lb/>
and utter rejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his<lb/>
enchantment, Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell<lb/>
than stepped into his boat, and returned to his ship.</p>
<p>Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the<lb/>
strange vessel was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and<lb/>
thither at every dark spot, however small, on the sea. This<lb/>
way and that her yards were swung round; starboard and<lb/>
larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a head<lb/>
sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her<lb/>
masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall<lb/>
cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.</p>
<p>But by her still halting course and winding, woful way, you<lb/>
plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained<lb/>
without comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children,<lb/>
because they were not.</p>

<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="sc">Lad</hi>, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The<lb/>

which I feel too curing to my malady. Like cures like; and<lb/>
for this hunt, my malady becomes my most desired health. Do<lb/>
thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee, as if thou<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use<lb/>

no more, so I remain a part of ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip,<lb/>
whose drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of<lb/>
his living skin. But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did<lb/>
him. Sir, I must go with ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab&#x0027;s purpose<lb/>
keels up in him. I tell thee no; it cannot be.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh good master, master, master!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab<lb/>
too is mad. Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon<lb/>

Thy hand!&#x2014;Met! True art thou, lad, as the circumference<lb/>

<p>(<hi rend="i">Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward</hi>.)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,&#x2014;but I&#x0027;m<lb/>
alone. Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but<lb/>
he&#x0027;s missing. Pip! Pip! Ding, dong, ding! Who&#x0027;s seen Pip?<lb/>
He must be up here; let&#x0027;s try the door. What? neither lock,<lb/>
nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there&#x0027;s no opening it. It must be<lb/>

transom, in the ship&#x0027;s full middle, all her keel and her three<lb/>

over rows of captains and lieutenants. Ha! what&#x0027;s this? epau-<lb/>

<hi rend="sc">the hat</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">And</hi> now that at the proper time and place, after so long and<lb/>
wide a preliminary cruise, Ahab,&#x2014;all other whaling waters<lb/>
swept&#x2014;seemed to have chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay<lb/>
him the more securely there; now, that he found himself hard<lb/>
by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound<lb/>
had been inflicted; now that a vessel had been spoken which<lb/>
on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby<lb/>
Dick;&#x2014;and now that all his successive meetings with various<lb/>
ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indiffer-<lb/>
ence with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n627" n="590"/>
sinning or sinned against; now it was that there lurked a<lb/>
something in the old man&#x0027;s eyes, which it was hardly sufferable<lb/>
for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting polar star, which<lb/>
through the livelong, arctic, six months&#x0027; night sustains its<lb/>
piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab&#x0027;s purpose now fixedly<lb/>
gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew.<lb/>
It domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts,<lb/>
misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and<lb/>
not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.</p>
<p>In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natu-<lb/>
ral, vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck<lb/>
no more strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and<lb/>
fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time,<lb/>
in the clamped mortar of Ahab&#x0027;s iron soul. Like machines,<lb/>
they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious that the old<lb/>
man&#x0027;s despot eye was on them.</p>
<p>But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential<lb/>
hours; when he thought no glance but one was on him; then<lb/>
you would have seen that even as Ahab&#x0027;s eyes so awed the<lb/>
crew&#x0027;s, the inscrutable Parsee&#x0027;s glance awed his; or somehow,<lb/>
at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an added,<lb/>
gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now;<lb/>
such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked<lb/>
dubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed<lb/>
he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast<lb/>
upon the deck by some unseen being&#x0027;s body. And that shadow<lb/>
was always hovering there. For not by night, even, had Fe-<lb/>
dallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go below. He<lb/>
would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan<lb/>
but wondrous eyes did plainly say&#x2014;We two watchmen never<lb/>
rest.</p>
<p>Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now<lb/>
step upon the deck, unless Ahab was before them; either stand-<lb/>
ing in his pivot-hole, or exactly pacing the planks between two<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n628" n="591"/>
undeviating limits,&#x2014;the main-mast and the mizen; or else they<lb/>
saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,&#x2014;his living foot advanced<lb/>
upon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over his<lb/>
eyes; so that however motionless he stood, however the days<lb/>
and nights were added on, that he had not swung in his ham-<lb/>
mock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never<lb/>
tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed<lb/>
at times: or whether he was still intently scanning them; no<lb/>
matter, though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on<lb/>
the stretch, and the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of<lb/>
dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The clothes that the<lb/>
night had wet, the next day&#x0027;s sunshine dried upon him; and<lb/>
so, day after day, and night after night; he went no more<lb/>
beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that<lb/>
thing he sent for.</p>
<p>He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,&#x2014;<lb/>
breakfast and dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped<lb/>
his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots<lb/>
of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at naked base,<lb/>
though perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole<lb/>
life was now become one watch on deck; and though the<lb/>
Parsee&#x0027;s mystic watch was without intermission as his own;<lb/>
yet these two never seemed to speak&#x2014;one man to the other&#x2014;<lb/>
unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter<lb/>
made it necessary. Though such a potent spell seemed secretly<lb/>
to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck crew, they<lb/>
seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak<lb/>
one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned<lb/>
the slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours,<lb/>
without a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight;<lb/>
Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still<lb/>
fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw<lb/>
his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned sub-<lb/>
stance.</p>
<pb xml:id="n629" n="592"/>
<p>And yet, somehow, did Ahab&#x2014;in his own proper self, as<lb/>
daily, hourly, and every instant, commandingly revealed to his<lb/>
subordinates,&#x2014;Ahab seemed an independent lord; the Parsee<lb/>
but his slave. Still again both seemed yoked together, and an<lb/>
unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid<lb/>
rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid<lb/>
Ahab.</p>
<p>At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice<lb/>
was heard from aft&#x2014;&#x201C;Man the mast-heads!&#x201D;&#x2014;and all through<lb/>
the day, till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every<lb/>
hour, at the striking of the helmsman&#x0027;s bell, was heard&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;What d&#x0027;ye see?&#x2014;sharp! sharp!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the<lb/>
children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen;<lb/>
the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crew&#x0027;s<lb/>
fidelity; at least, of nearly all except the Pagan harpooneers;<lb/>
he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not<lb/>
willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these suspicions<lb/>
were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing<lb/>
them, however his actions might seem to hint them.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I will have the first sight of the whale myself,&#x201D;&#x2014;he said.<lb/>
&#x201C;Aye! Ahab must have the doubloon!&#x201D; and with his own<lb/>
hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines; and sending a<lb/>
hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to the main-<lb/>
mast head, he received the two ends of the downward-reeved<lb/>
rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the<lb/>
other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that<lb/>
end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round<lb/>
upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his<lb/>
glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning<lb/>
Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief<lb/>
mate, said,&#x2014;&#x201C;Take the rope, sir&#x2014;I give it into thy hands,<lb/>
Starbuck.&#x201D; Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave<lb/>
the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n630" n="593"/>
the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood<lb/>
near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the royal<lb/>
mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,&#x2014;<lb/>
ahead, astern, this side, and that,&#x2014;within the wide expanded<lb/>
circle commanded at so great a height.</p>
<p>When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated<lb/>
place in the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the<lb/>
sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by<lb/>
the rope; under these circumstances, its fastened end on deck<lb/>
is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the<lb/>
special watch of it. Because in such a wilderness of running<lb/>
rigging, whose various different relations aloft cannot always be<lb/>
infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck; and<lb/>
when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes<lb/>
cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality,<lb/>
if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor<lb/>
should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall<lb/>
all swooping to the sea. So Ahab&#x0027;s proceedings in this matter<lb/>
were not unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed<lb/>
to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who had ever<lb/>
ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree<lb/>
approaching to decision&#x2014;one of those too, whose faithfulness on<lb/>
the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;&#x2014;it was strange,<lb/>
that this was the very man he should select for his watchman;<lb/>
freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted<lb/>
person&#x0027;s hands.</p>
<p>Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had<lb/>
been there ten minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks<lb/>
which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned<lb/>
mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes; one of these birds<lb/>
came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of un-<lb/>
trackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet straight<lb/>
up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying<lb/>
again round his head.</p>
<pb xml:id="n631" n="594"/>
<p>But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon,<lb/>
Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would<lb/>
any one else have marked it much, it being no uncommon cir-<lb/>
cumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to<lb/>
see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your hat, your hat, sir!&#x201D; suddenly cried the Sicilian sea-<lb/>
man, who being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly<lb/>
behind Ahab, though somewhat lower than his level, and with a<lb/>
deep gulf of air dividing them.</p>
<p>But already the sable wing was before the old man&#x0027;s eyes;<lb/>
the long hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black<lb/>
hawk darted away with his prize.</p>
<p>An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin&#x0027;s head, removing his cap<lb/>
to replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that<lb/>
Tarquin would be king of Rome. But only by the replacing<lb/>
of the cap was that omen accounted good. Ahab&#x0027;s hat was<lb/>
never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far in<lb/>
advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while from the<lb/>
point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly dis-<lb/>
cerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days<lb/>
went by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another<lb/>
ship, most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As<lb/>
she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upom her broad beams, called<lb/>
shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at<lb/>
the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare,<lb/>
unrigged, or disabled boats.</p>
<pb xml:id="n632" n="595"/>
<p>Upon the stranger&#x0027;s shears were beheld the shattered, white<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;The harpoon is not yet forged that will ever do that,&#x201D;<lb/>

busy in sewing together.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not forged!&#x201D; and snatching Perth&#x0027;s levelled iron from the<lb/>
crotch, Ahab held it out, exclaiming&#x2014;&#x201C;Look ye, Nantucketer;<lb/>
here in this hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and<lb/>
tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to temper<lb/>
them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White<lb/>
Whale most feels his accursed life!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then God keep thee, old man&#x2014;see&#x0027;st thou that&#x201D;&#x2014;point-<lb/>
ing to the hammock&#x2014;&#x201C;I bury but one of five stout men, who<lb/>
were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only <hi rend="i">that</hi><lb/>
one I bury; the rest were buried before they died; you sail upon<lb/>
their tomb.&#x201D; Then turning to his crew&#x2014;&#x201C;Are ye ready there?<lb/>
place the plank then on the rail, and lift the body; so, then&#x2014;<lb/>
Oh! God&#x201D;&#x2014;advancing towards the hammock with uplifted<lb/>
hands&#x2014;&#x201C;may the resurrection and the life&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Brace forward! Up helm!&#x201D; cried Ahab like lightning to<lb/>
his men.</p>
<p>But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to<lb/>
escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it<lb/>
struck the sea; not so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying<lb/>
bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly bap-<lb/>
tism.</p>
<pb xml:id="n633" n="596"/>
<p>As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange<lb/>
life-buoy hanging at the Pequod&#x0027;s stern came into conspicuous<lb/>
relief.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!&#x201D; cried a foreboding voice<lb/>
in her wake. &#x201C;In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial;<lb/>
ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin!&#x201D;</p>

<head>CHAPTER CXXXII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the symphony</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea<lb/>
were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the<lb/>
pensive air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman&#x0027;s<lb/>
look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved with long,<lb/>
strong, lingering swells, as Samson&#x0027;s chest in his sleep.</p>
<p>Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of<lb/>
small, unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the<lb/>
feminine air; but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bot-<lb/>
tomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks;<lb/>
and these were the strong, troubled, murderous thinkings of the<lb/>
masculine sea.</p>
<p>But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in<lb/>
shades and shadows without; those two seemed one; it was<lb/>
only the sex, as it were, that distinguished them.</p>
<p>Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this<lb/>
gentle air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to<lb/>
groom. And at the girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tre-<lb/>
mulous motion&#x2014;most seen here at the equator&#x2014;denoted the fond,<lb/>
throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride<lb/>
gave her bosom away.</p>
<p>Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles;<lb/>
haggardly firm and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n634" n="597"/>
that still glow in the ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood<lb/>
forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his splintered helmet<lb/>
of a brow to the fair girl&#x0027;s forehead of heaven.</p>
<p>Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible<lb/>
winged creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood<lb/>
of air and sky! how oblivious were ye of old Ahab&#x0027;s close-coiled<lb/>
woe! But so have I seen little Miriam and Martha, laughing-<lb/>
eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around their old sire; sporting<lb/>
with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of<lb/>
that burnt-out crater of his brain.</p>
<p>Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over<lb/>
the side, and watched how his shadow in the water sank and<lb/>
sank to his gaze, the more and the more that he strove to pierce<lb/>
the profundity. But the lovely aromas in that enchanted air<lb/>
did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in<lb/>
his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last<lb/>
stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long cruel&#x2014;-<lb/>
forbidding&#x2014;now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn<lb/>
neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one,<lb/>
that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her<lb/>
heart to save and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat<lb/>
Ahab dropped a tear into the sea; nor did all the Pacific con-<lb/>
tain such wealth as that one wee drop.</p>
<p>Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned<lb/>
over the side; and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the<lb/>
measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity<lb/>
around. Careful not to touch him, or be noticed by him, he<lb/>
yet drew near to him, and stood there.</p>
<p>Ahab turned.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Starbuck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking<lb/>
sky. On such a day&#x2014;very much such a sweetness as this&#x2014;I<lb/>
struck my first whale&#x2014;a boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty&#x2014;</p>
<pb xml:id="n635" n="598"/>
<p>forty&#x2014;forty years ago!&#x2014;ago! Forty years of continual whal-<lb/>
ing! forty years of privation, and peril, and storm-time! forty<lb/>
years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab forsaken the<lb/>
peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of the<lb/>
deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have<lb/>
not spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the<lb/>
desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of<lb/>
a Captain&#x0027;s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to<lb/>
any sympathy from the green country without&#x2014;oh, weariness!<lb/>
heaviness! Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!&#x2014;when<lb/>
I think of all this; only half-suspected, not so keenly known to<lb/>
me before&#x2014;and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted<lb/>
fare&#x2014;fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soul!&#x2014;when<lb/>
the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand, and<lb/>
broken the world&#x0027;s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts&#x2014;away,<lb/>
whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past<lb/>
fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one<lb/>
dent in my marriage pillow&#x2014;wife? wife?&#x2014;rather a widow with<lb/>
her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I<lb/>
married her, Starbuck; and then, the madness, the frenzy, the<lb/>
boiling blood and the smoking brow, with which, for a thousand<lb/>
lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly chased his prey&#x2014;<lb/>
more a demon than a man!&#x2014;aye, aye! what a forty years&#x0027;<lb/>
fool&#x2014;fool&#x2014;old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of<lb/>
the chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the<lb/>
iron, and the lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now?<lb/>
Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not hard, that with this weary load<lb/>
I bear, one poor leg should have been snatched from under me?<lb/>
Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me, that I seem to<lb/>
weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some<lb/>
ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck?<lb/>
I feel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were<lb/>
Adam, staggering beneath the piled centuries since Paradise.<lb/>
God! God! God!&#x2014;crack my heart!&#x2014;stave my brain!&#x2014;mock-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n636" n="599"/>
cry! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs, have I<lb/>
ived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus intolerably<lb/>
old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a<lb/>
human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better<lb/>
than to gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright<lb/>
hearth-stone! this is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and<lb/>
my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on board!&#x2014;<lb/>
lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby<lb/>
Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the<lb/>
far away home I see in that eye!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart,<lb/>
after all! why should any one give chase to that hated fish!<lb/>
Away with me! let us fly these deadly waters! let us home!<lb/>
Wife and child, too, are Starbuck&#x0027;s&#x2014;wife and child of his<lb/>
brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow youth; even as thine, sir, are the<lb/>
wife and child of thy loving, longing, paternal old age! Away!<lb/>
let us away!&#x2014;this instant let me alter the course! How<lb/>
cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl on<lb/>
our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have<lb/>
some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They have, they have. I have seen them&#x2014;some summer<lb/>
days in the morning. About this time&#x2014;yes, it is his noon nap<lb/>
now&#x2014;the boy vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his<lb/>
mother tells him of me, of cannibal old me; how I am abroad<lb/>
upon the deep, but will yet come back to dance him again.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my<lb/>
boy, every morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the<lb/>
first glimpse of his father&#x0027;s sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is<lb/>
done! we head for Nantucket! Come, my Captain, study out<lb/>
the course, and let us away! See, see! the boy&#x0027;s face from<lb/>
the window! the boy&#x0027;s hand on the hill!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Ahab&#x0027;s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he<lb/>
shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it;</p>
<pb xml:id="n637" n="600"/>
<p>what cozzening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless<lb/>
emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and<lb/>
longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself<lb/>
on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my<lb/>
own proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare? Is<lb/>
Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm?<lb/>
But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-<lb/>
boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some<lb/>
invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this<lb/>
one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beat-<lb/>
ing, does that thinking, does that living, and not I. By heaven,<lb/>
man, we are turned round and round in this world, like yonder<lb/>
windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all the time, lo! that<lb/>
smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon Albicore!<lb/>
who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where<lb/>
do murderers go, man! Who&#x0027;s to doom, when the judge<lb/>
himself is dragged to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind,<lb/>
and a mild looking sky; and the airs smells now, as if it blew<lb/>
from a far-away meadow; they have been making hay some-<lb/>
where under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the mow-<lb/>
ers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye,<lb/>
toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep?<lb/>
Aye, and rust amid greenness; as last year&#x0027;s scythes flung down,<lb/>
and left in the half-cut swaths&#x2014;Starbuck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But blanched to a corpse&#x0027;s hue with despair, the Mate had<lb/>
stolen away.</p>
<p>Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but<lb/>
started at two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedal-<lb/>
lah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail.</p>

<head>CHAPTER CXXXIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the chase&#x2014;first day</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">That</hi> night, in the mid-watch, when the old man&#x2014;as his<lb/>
wont at intervals&#x2014;stepped forth from the scuttle in which<lb/>
he leaned, and went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out<lb/>
his face fiercely, snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
dog will, in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle. He declared<lb/>
that a whale must be near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes<lb/>
to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale, was<lb/>
palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised when,<lb/>
after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then<lb/>
ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as pos-<lb/>
sible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship&#x0027;s course to be slightly<lb/>
altered, and the sail to be shortened.</p>
<p>The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently<lb/>
vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea<lb/>
directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in<lb/>
the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-<lb/>
like marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid<lb/>
stream.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on<lb/>
the forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judg-<lb/>
ment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so<lb/>
instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their<lb/>
hands.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What d&#x0027;ye see?&#x201D; cried Ahab, flattening his face to the<lb/>
sky.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nothing, nothing, sir!&#x201D; was the sound hailing down in<lb/>
reply.</p>
<pb xml:id="n639" n="602"/>
<p>&#x201C;T&#x0027;gallant sails!&#x2014;stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both<lb/>
sides!&#x201D;</p>
<p>All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for<lb/>
swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few<lb/>
moments they were hoisting him thither, when, while but two<lb/>
thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the<lb/>
horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-<lb/>
sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air, &#x201C;There she blows!&#x2014;<lb/>
there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby<lb/>
Dick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by<lb/>
the three look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging<lb/>
to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing.<lb/>
Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above the other<lb/>
look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the<lb/>
top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian&#x0027;s head was almost on a<lb/>
level with Ahab&#x0027;s heel. From this height the whale was now<lb/>
seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing<lb/>
his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout<lb/>
into the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same<lb/>
silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic<lb/>
and Indian Oceans.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And did none of ye see it before?&#x201D; cried Ahab, hailing the<lb/>
perched men all around him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab<lb/>
did, and I cried out,&#x201D; said Tashtego.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not the same instant; not the same&#x2014;no, the doubloon is<lb/>
mine, Fate reserved the doubloon for me. <hi rend="i">I</hi> only; none of ye<lb/>
could have raised the White Whale first. There she blows!<lb/>
there she blows!&#x2014;there she blows! There again!&#x2014;there<lb/>
again!&#x201D; he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones,<lb/>
attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale&#x0027;s visible<lb/>
jets. &#x201C;He&#x0027;s going to sound! In stunsails! Down top-<lb/>
gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n640" n="603"/>
stay on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff<lb/>
a point! So; steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No,<lb/>
no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand<lb/>
by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,&#x2014;quick,<lb/>
quicker!&#x201D; and he slid through the air to the deck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He is heading straight to leeward, sir,&#x201D; cried Stubb, &#x201C;right<lb/>
away from us; cannot have seen the ship yet.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the<lb/>
helm!&#x2014;brace up! Shiver her!&#x2014;shiver her! So; well that!<lb/>
Boats, boats!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Soon all the boats but Starbuck&#x0027;s were dropped; all the<lb/>
boat-sails set&#x2014;all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness,<lb/>
shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale,<lb/>
death-glimmer lit up Fedallah&#x0027;s sunken eyes; a hideous motion<lb/>
gnawed his mouth.</p>
<p>Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through<lb/>
the sea; but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared<lb/>
him, the ocean grew still more smooth; seemed drawing a<lb/>
carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so serenely it<lb/>
spread. At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his<lb/>
seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was<lb/>
distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing,<lb/>
and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish<lb/>
foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly pro-<lb/>
jecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-<lb/>
rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his<lb/>
broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompany-<lb/>
ing the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably<lb/>
flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on<lb/>
either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But<lb/>
these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay<lb/>
fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight;<lb/>
and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an<lb/>
argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n641" n="604"/>
from the white whale&#x0027;s back; and at intervals one of the cloud<lb/>
of soft-toed fowels hovering, and to and fro skimming like<lb/>
a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole,<lb/>
the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.</p>
<p>A gentle joyousness&#x2014;a mighty mildness of repose in swift-<lb/>
ness, invested the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter<lb/>
swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful<lb/>
horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid;<lb/>
with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight for the nup-<lb/>
tial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme!<lb/>
did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.</p>
<p>On each soft side&#x2014;coincident with the parted swell, that but<lb/>
once leaving him, then flowed so wide away&#x2014;on each bright side,<lb/>
the whale shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some<lb/>
among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured<lb/>
by all this serenity, had ventured to assail it; but had fatally<lb/>
found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm,<lb/>
enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all who for the<lb/>
first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way<lb/>
thou may&#x0027;st have bejuggled and destroyed before.</p>
<p>And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea,<lb/>
among waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceed-<lb/>
ing rapture, Moby Dick moved on, still withholding from sight<lb/>
the full terrors of his submerged trunk, entirely hiding the<lb/>
wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of<lb/>
him slowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole mar-<lb/>
bleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia&#x0027;s Natural Bridge,<lb/>
and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the grand<lb/>
god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hover-<lb/>
ingly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls long-<lb/>
ingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.</p>
<p>With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails<lb/>
adrift, the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick&#x0027;s<lb/>
reappearance.</p>
<pb xml:id="n642" n="605"/>
<p>&#x201C;An hour,&#x201D; said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat&#x0027;s stern;<lb/>
and he gazed beyond the whale&#x0027;s place, towards the dim blue<lb/>
spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an<lb/>
instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as<lb/>
he swept the watery circle. The breeze now freshened; the<lb/>
sea began to swell.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The birds!&#x2014;the birds!&#x201D; cried Tashtego.</p>
<p>In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white<lb/>
birds were now all flying towards Ahab&#x0027;s boat; and when<lb/>
within a few yards began fluttering over the water there, wheel-<lb/>
ing round and round, with joyous, expectant cries. Their<lb/>
vision was keener than man&#x0027;s; Ahab could discover no sign<lb/>
in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into<lb/>
its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than<lb/>
a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnify-<lb/>
ing as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed<lb/>
two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up<lb/>
from the undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick&#x0027;s open<lb/>
mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast, shadowed bulk still half<lb/>
blending with the blue of the sea. The glittering mouth<lb/>
yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb;<lb/>
and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab<lb/>
whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then,<lb/>
calling upon Fedallah to change places with him, went forward<lb/>
to the bows, and seizing Perth&#x0027;s harpoon, commanded his crew<lb/>
to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.</p>
<p>Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat<lb/>
upon its axis, its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s head while yet under water. But as if perceiving this<lb/>
stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence ascribed<lb/>
to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant,<lb/>
shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.</p>
<p>Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it<lb/>
thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n643" n="606"/>
the manner of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its<lb/>
bows full within his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled<lb/>
lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the teeth<lb/>
caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the inside of<lb/>
the jaw was within six inches of Ahab&#x0027;s head, and reached<lb/>
higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook<lb/>
the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unasto-<lb/>
nished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the tiger-<lb/>
yellow crew were tumbling over each other&#x0027;s heads to gain the<lb/>
uttermost stern.</p>
<p>And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and<lb/>
out, as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish<lb/>
way; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat, he<lb/>
could not be darted at from the bows, for the bows were almost<lb/>
inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats involun-<lb/>
tarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand,<lb/>
then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantaliz-<lb/>
ing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and helpless<lb/>
in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized the<lb/>
long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it<lb/>
from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped<lb/>
from him; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped,<lb/>
as both jaws, like an enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit<lb/>
the craft completely in twain, and locked themselves fast again<lb/>
in the sea, midway between the two floating wrecks. These<lb/>
floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the stern-<lb/>
wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the<lb/>
oars to lash them across.</p>
<p>At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped,<lb/>
Ahab, the first to perceive the whale&#x0027;s intent, by the crafty up-<lb/>
raising of his head, a movement that loosed his hold for the<lb/>
time; at that moment his hand had made one final effort to<lb/>
push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping further into the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n644" n="607"/>
had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he<lb/>
leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.</p>
<p>Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay<lb/>
at a little distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head<lb/>
up and down in the billows; and at the same time slowly<lb/>
revolving his whole spindled body; so that when his vast<lb/>
wrinkled forehead rose&#x2014;some twenty or more feet out of the<lb/>
water&#x2014;the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,<lb/>
dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered<lb/>
spray still higher into the air.<note xml:id="fn22-607"><p>This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.</p></note> So, in a gale, the but half<lb/>
baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddy-<lb/>
stone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.</p>
<p>But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam<lb/>
swiftly round and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning<lb/>
the water in his vengeful wake, as if lashing himself up to still<lb/>
another and more deadly assault. The sight of the splintered<lb/>
boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mul-<lb/>
berries cast before Antiochus&#x0027;s elephants in the book of Macca-<lb/>
bees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,&#x2014;though<lb/>
he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool<lb/>
as that; helpless Ahab&#x0027;s head was seen, like a tossed bubble<lb/>
which the least chance shock might burst. From the boat&#x0027;s<lb/>
fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him;<lb/>
the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor<lb/>
him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.<lb/>
For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale&#x0027;s aspect, and<lb/>
so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that<lb/>
he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n645" n="608"/>
other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared<lb/>
not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal<lb/>
for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab<lb/>
and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape.<lb/>
With straining eyes, then, they remained on the outer edge<lb/>
of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man&#x0027;s<lb/>
head.</p>
<p>Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from<lb/>
the ship&#x0027;s mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne<lb/>
down upon the scene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the<lb/>
water hailed her;&#x2014;&#x201C;Sail on the&#x201D;&#x2014;but that moment a breaking<lb/>
sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the<lb/>
time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on<lb/>
a towering crest, he shouted,&#x2014;&#x201C;Sail on the whale!&#x2014;Drive him<lb/>
off!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Pequod&#x0027;s prows were pointed; and breaking up the<lb/>
charmed circle, she effectually parted the white whale from his<lb/>
victim. As he sullenly swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.</p>
<p>Dragged into Stubb&#x0027;s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the<lb/>
white brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
bodily strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body&#x0027;s<lb/>
doom: for a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb&#x0027;s<lb/>
boat, like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants. Far<lb/>
inland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate sounds from<lb/>
out ravines.</p>
<p>But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much<lb/>
the more abbreviate it. In an instant&#x0027;s compass, great hearts<lb/>
sometimes condense to one deep pang, the sum total of those<lb/>
shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler men&#x0027;s whole lives.<lb/>
And so, such hearts, though summary in each one suffering;<lb/>
still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole<lb/>
age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous intensities; for<lb/>
even in their pointless centres, those noble natures contain the<lb/>
entire circumferences of inferior souls.</p>
<pb xml:id="n646" n="609"/>
<p>&#x201C;The harpoon,&#x201D; said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly<lb/>
leaning on one bended arm&#x2014;&#x201C;is it safe?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,&#x201D; said Stubb,<lb/>
showing it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lay it before me;&#x2014;any missing men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;One, two, three, four, five;&#x2014;there were five oars, sir, and<lb/>
here are five men.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x0027;s good.&#x2014;Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so,<lb/>
I see him! there! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping<lb/>
spout!&#x2014;Hands off from me! The eternal sap runs up in<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s bones again! Set the sail; out oars; the helm!&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being<lb/>
picked up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and<lb/>
the chase is thus continued with what is called double-banked<lb/>
oars. It was thus now. But the added power of the boat did<lb/>
not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have<lb/>
treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which<lb/>
plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances, pushed<lb/>
on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a<lb/>
hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period,<lb/>
such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing<lb/>
barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship<lb/>
itself, then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising<lb/>
intermediate means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the<lb/>
boats now made for her, and were soon swayed up to their<lb/>
cranes&#x2014;the two parts of the wrecked boat having been<lb/>
previously secured by her&#x2014;and then hoisting everything to her<lb/>
side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretch-<lb/>
ing it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an<lb/>
albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-<lb/>
Dick. At the well known, methodic intervals, the whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned<lb/>
mast-heads; and when he would be reported as just gone down,<lb/>
Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n647" n="610"/>
watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour<lb/>
expired, his voice was heard.&#x2014;&#x201C;Whose is the doubloon now?<lb/>
D&#x0027;ye see him?&#x201D; and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he<lb/>
commanded them to lift him to his perch. In this way the<lb/>
day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly<lb/>
pacing the planks.</p>
<p>As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail<lb/>
the men aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to<lb/>
spread one to a still greater breadth&#x2014;thus to and fro pacing,<lb/>
beneath his slouched hat, at every turn he passed his own<lb/>
wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck,<lb/>
and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At last<lb/>
he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky<lb/>
fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old<lb/>
man&#x0027;s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.</p>
<p>Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly,<lb/>
though, to evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up<lb/>
a valiant place in his Captain&#x0027;s mind, he advanced, and eyeing<lb/>
the wreck exclaimed&#x2014;&#x201C;The thistle the ass refused; it pricked<lb/>
his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?<lb/>
Man, man! did I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as<lb/>
mechanical) I could swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor<lb/>
laugh should be heard before a wreck.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, sir,&#x201D; said Starbuck drawing near, &#x201C;&#x0027;tis a solemn sight;<lb/>
an omen, and an ill one.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Omen? omen?&#x2014;the dictionary! If the gods think to<lb/>
speak outright to man, they will honorably speak outright; not<lb/>
shake their heads, and give an old wives&#x0027; darkling hint.&#x2014;<lb/>
Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing; Starbuck<lb/>
is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all<lb/>
mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the<lb/>
peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold,<lb/>
cold&#x2014;I shiver!&#x2014;How now? Aloft there! D&#x0027;ye see him?<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n648" n="611"/>
Sing out for every spout, though he spout ten times a<lb/>
second!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe<lb/>
was rustling. Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men<lb/>
still remained unset.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can&#x0027;t see the spout now, sir;&#x2014;too dark&#x201D;&#x2014;cried a voice<lb/>
from the air.</p>
<p>&#x201C;How heading when last seen?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;As before, sir,&#x2014;straight to leeward.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good! he will travel slower now &#x0027;tis night. Down royals<lb/>
and top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over<lb/>
him before morning; he&#x0027;s making a passage now, and may<lb/>
heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full before the wind!<lb/>
mdash;Aloft! come down!&#x2014;Mr. Stubb, send a fresh hand to the<lb/>
fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning.&#x201D;&#x2014;Then<lb/>
advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast&#x2014;&#x201C;Men, this<lb/>
gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till<lb/>
the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises<lb/>
him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man&#x0027;s;<lb/>
and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its<lb/>
sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away now!&#x2014;the deck<lb/>
is thine, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle,<lb/>
and slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at<lb/>
intervals rousing himself to see how the night wore on.</p>

<head>CHAPTER CXXXIV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the chase&#x2014;second day</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">At</hi> day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned<lb/>
afresh.</p>
<pb xml:id="n649" n="612"/>
<p>&#x201C;D&#x0027;ye see him?&#x201D; cried Ahab, after allowing a little space for<lb/>
the light to spread.</p>
<p>&#x201C;See nothing, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I<lb/>
thought for;&#x2014;the top-gallant sails!&#x2014;aye, they should have<lb/>
been kept on her all night. But no matter&#x2014;&#x0027;tis but resting<lb/>
for the rush.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particu-<lb/>
lar whale, continued through day into night, and through night<lb/>
into day, is a thing by no means unprecedented in the South<lb/>
sea fishery. For such is the wonderful skill, prescience of<lb/>
experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great<lb/>
natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from<lb/>
the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will,<lb/>
under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell<lb/>
both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time,<lb/>
while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of progression<lb/>
during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot,<lb/>
when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he<lb/>
well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again,<lb/>
but at some further point; like as this pilot stands by his com-<lb/>
pass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible,<lb/>
in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen<lb/>
headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at<lb/>
his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and dili-<lb/>
gently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when<lb/>
night obscures the fish, the creature&#x0027;s future wake through the<lb/>
darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the<lb/>
hunter, as the pilot&#x0027;s coast is to him. So that to this hunter&#x0027;s<lb/>
wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in<lb/>
water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as<lb/>
the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the<lb/>
modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace, that,<lb/>
with watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n650" n="613"/>
that of a baby&#x0027;s pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or the<lb/>
down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an<lb/>
hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these Nan-<lb/>
tucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to<lb/>
the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so<lb/>
many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles,<lb/>
will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or<lb/>
longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful in the<lb/>
end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman&#x0027;s allies; for<lb/>
of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is<lb/>
the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and<lb/>
a quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are<lb/>
many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales.</p>
<p>The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when<lb/>
a cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.</p>
<p>&#x201C;By salt and hemp!&#x201D; cried Stubb, &#x201C;but this swift motion of<lb/>
the deck creeps up one&#x0027;s legs and tingles at the heart. This<lb/>
ship and I are two brave fellows!&#x2014;Ha! ha! Some one take<lb/>
me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on the sea,&#x2014;for by live-oaks!<lb/>
my spine&#x0027;s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait that leaves no dust<lb/>
behind!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;There she blows&#x2014;she blows!&#x2014;she blows!&#x2014;right ahead!<lb/>
rdquo; was now the mast-head cry.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye!&#x201D; cried Stubb, &#x201C;I knew it&#x2014;ye can&#x0027;t escape&#x2014;blow<lb/>
on and split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is<lb/>
after ye! blow your trump&#x2014;blister your lungs!&#x2014;Ahab will<lb/>
dam off your blood, as a miller shuts his water-gate upon the<lb/>
stream!&#x201D;</p>
<p>And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew.<lb/>
The frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bub-<lb/>
blingly up, like old wine worked anew. Whatever pale fears<lb/>
and forebodings some of them might have felt before; these<lb/>
were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n651" n="614"/>
of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as<lb/>
timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The<lb/>
hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring<lb/>
perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night&#x0027;s suspense;<lb/>
the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft<lb/>
went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these things,<lb/>
their hearts were bowled along. The wind that made great<lb/>
bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible<lb/>
as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency<lb/>
which so enslaved them to the race.</p>
<p>They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that<lb/>
held them all; though it was put together of all contrasting<lb/>
things&#x2014;oak, and maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and<lb/>
hemp&#x2014;yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete<lb/>
hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the<lb/>
long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the crew,<lb/>
this man&#x0027;s valor, that man&#x0027;s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all<lb/>
varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to<lb/>
that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point<lb/>
to.</p>
<p>The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall<lb/>
palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Cling-<lb/>
ing to a spar with one hand, some reached forth the other with<lb/>
impatient wavings; others, shading their eyes from the vivid<lb/>
sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all the spars in full<lb/>
bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah! how they<lb/>
still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing<lb/>
that might destroy them!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?&#x201D; cried Ahab,<lb/>
when, after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no<lb/>
more had been heard. &#x201C;Sway me up, men; ye have been<lb/>
deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way, and then<lb/>
disappears.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n652" n="615"/>
mistaken some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event<lb/>
itself soon proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch;<lb/>
hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck<lb/>
the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with<lb/>
the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo of<lb/>
thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as&#x2014;much nearer to the ship<lb/>
than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead&#x2014;<lb/>
Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and<lb/>
indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic<lb/>
fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vici-<lb/>
nity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching.<lb/>
Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths, the<lb/>
Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element<lb/>
of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his<lb/>
place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,<lb/>
the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his<lb/>
mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of defiance.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There she breaches! there she breaches!&#x201D; was the cry, as<lb/>
in his immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself<lb/>
salmon-like to Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of<lb/>
the sea, and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky,<lb/>
the spray that he raised, for the moment, intolerably glittered<lb/>
and glared like a glacier; and stood there gradually fading and<lb/>
fading away from its first sparkling intensity, to the dim misti-<lb/>
ness of an advancing shower in a vale.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!&#x201D; cried Ahab,<lb/>
&#x201C;thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand!&#x2014;Down! down all<lb/>
of ye, but one man at the fore. The boats!&#x2014;stand by!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the<lb/>
men, like shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated back-<lb/>
stays and halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly<lb/>
was dropped from his perch.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lower away,&#x201D; he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat<lb/>
mdash;a spare one, rigged the afternoon previous. &#x201C;Mr. Starbuck,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n653" n="616"/>
the ship is thine&#x2014;keep away from the boats, but keep near<lb/>
them. Lower, all!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being<lb/>
the first assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now<lb/>
coming for the three crews. Ahab&#x0027;s boat was central; and<lb/>
cheering his men, he told them he would take the whale head-<lb/>
and-head,&#x2014;that is, pull straight up to his forehead,&#x2014;a not<lb/>
uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such a course<lb/>
excludes the coming onset from the whale&#x0027;s sidelong vision.<lb/>
But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three<lb/>
boats were plain as the ship&#x0027;s three masts to his eye; the White<lb/>
Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant<lb/>
as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a<lb/>
lashing tail, offered appalling battle on every side; and heedless<lb/>
of the irons darted at him from every boat, seemed only intent<lb/>
on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were<lb/>
made. But skilfully man&#x0153;uvred, incessantly wheeling like<lb/>
trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him;<lb/>
though, at times, but by a plank&#x0027;s breadth; while all the time,<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.</p>
<p>But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so<lb/>
crossed and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the<lb/>
slack of the three lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened,<lb/>
and, of themselves, warped the devoted boats towards the<lb/>
planted irons in him; though now for a moment the whale<lb/>
drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge.<lb/>
Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more line: and<lb/>
then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again&#x2014;hoping<lb/>
that way to disencumber it of some snarls&#x2014;when lo!&#x2014;a sight<lb/>
more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!</p>
<p>Caught and twisted&#x2014;corkscrewed in the mazes of the line,<lb/>
loose harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and<lb/>
points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows<lb/>
of Ahab&#x0027;s boat. Only one thing could be done. Seizing the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n654" n="617"/>
boat-knife, he critically reached within&#x2014;through&#x2014;and then,<lb/>
without&#x2014;the rays of steel; dragged in the line beyond, passed<lb/>
it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering the rope<lb/>
near the chocks&#x2014;dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into<lb/>
the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White<lb/>
Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the<lb/>
other lines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved<lb/>
boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them<lb/>
together like two rolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and<lb/>
then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling mael-<lb/>
strom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the<lb/>
wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a<lb/>
swiftly stirred bowl of punch.</p>
<p>While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching<lb/>
out after the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture,<lb/>
while aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty<lb/>
vial, twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of<lb/>
sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle<lb/>
him up; and while the old man&#x0027;s line&#x2014;now parting&#x2014;admitted<lb/>
of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could;&#x2014;<lb/>
in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils,<lb/>
mdash;Ahab&#x0027;s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards Heaven<lb/>
by invisible wires,&#x2014;as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly from<lb/>
the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against<lb/>
its bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till<lb/>
it fell again&#x2014;gunwale downwards&#x2014;and Ahab and his men<lb/>
struggled out from under it, like seals from a sea-side cave.</p>
<p>The first uprising momentum of the whale&#x2014;modifying its<lb/>
direction as he struck the surface&#x2014;involuntarily launched him<lb/>
along it, to a little distance from the centre of the destruction<lb/>
he had made; and with his back to it, he now lay for a moment<lb/>
slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side; and whenever<lb/>
a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats<lb/>
touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and came sideways<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n655" n="618"/>
smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work for that<lb/>
time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the<lb/>
ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued<lb/>
his leeward way at a traveller&#x0027;s methodic pace.</p>
<p>As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight,<lb/>
again came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat,<lb/>
picked up the floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else<lb/>
could be caught at, and safely landed them on her decks. Some<lb/>
sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched<lb/>
harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered<lb/>
oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or even<lb/>
serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah<lb/>
the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his<lb/>
boat&#x0027;s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float;<lb/>
nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day&#x0027;s mishap.</p>
<p>But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened<lb/>
upon him; as instead of standing by himself he still half-hung<lb/>
upon the shoulder of Starbuck, who had thus far been the fore-<lb/>
most to assist him. His ivory leg had been snapped off, leaving<lb/>
but one short sharp splinter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye aye, Starbuck, &#x0027;tis sweet to lean sometimes, be<lb/>
the leaner who he will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener<lb/>
than he has.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The ferrule has not stood, sir,&#x201D; said the carpenter, now<lb/>
coming up; &#x201C;I put good work into that leg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But no bones broken, sir, I hope,&#x201D; said Stubb with true<lb/>
concern.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!&#x2014;d&#x0027;ye see it.&#x2014;But<lb/>
even with a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account<lb/>
no living bone of mine one jot more me, than this dead one<lb/>
that&#x0027;s lost. Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much<lb/>
as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being<lb/>
Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof?mdash;<lb/>
Aloft there! which way?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n656" n="619"/>
<p>&#x201C;Dead to leeward, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down<lb/>
the rest of the spare boats and rig them&#x2014;Mr. Starbuck away,<lb/>
and muster the boat&#x0027;s crews.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed<lb/>
fate! that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have<lb/>
such a craven mate!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane&#x2014;<lb/>
there, that shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I<lb/>
have not seen him yet. By heaven it cannot be!&#x2014;missing?&#x2014;<lb/>
quick! call them all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The old man&#x0027;s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering<lb/>
the company, the Parsee was not there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Parsee!&#x201D; cried Stubb&#x2014;&#x201C;he must have been caught<lb/>
in&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The black vomit wrench thee!&#x2014;run all of ye above, alow,<lb/>
cabin, forecastle&#x2014;find him&#x2014;not gone&#x2014;not gone!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the<lb/>
Parsee was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, sir,&#x201D; said Stubb&#x2014;&#x201C;caught among the tangles of your<lb/>
line&#x2014;I thought I saw him dragging under.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="i">My</hi> line! <hi rend="i">my</hi> line? Gone?&#x2014;gone? What means that<lb/>
little word?&#x2014;What death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes<lb/>
as if he were the belfry. The harpoon, too!&#x2014;toss over the<lb/>
litter there,&#x2014;d&#x0027;ye see it?&#x2014;the forged iron, men, the white<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s&#x2014;no, no, no,&#x2014;blistered fool! this hand did dart it!&#x2014;&#x0027;tis<lb/>
in the fish!&#x2014;Aloft there! Keep him nailed&#x2014;Quick!&#x2014;all<lb/>
hands to the rigging of the boats&#x2014;collect the oars&#x2014;harpooneers!<lb/>
the irons, the irons!&#x2014;hoist the royals higher&#x2014;a pull on all the<lb/>
sheets!&#x2014;helm there! steady, steady for your life! I&#x0027;ll ten<lb/>
times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight<lb/>
through it, but I&#x0027;ll slay him yet!&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n657" n="620"/>
<p>&#x201C;Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,&#x201D; cried<lb/>
Starbuck; &#x201C;never, never wilt thou capture him, old man&#x2014;In<lb/>
Jesus&#x0027; name no more of this, that&#x0027;s worse than devil&#x0027;s madness.<lb/>
Two days chased; twice stove to splinters; thy very leg once<lb/>
more snatched from under thee; thy evil shadow gone&#x2014;all<lb/>
good angels mobbing thee with warnings:&#x2014;what more wouldst<lb/>
thou have?&#x2014;Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till<lb/>
he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to<lb/>
the bottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the<lb/>
infernal world? Oh, oh,&#x2014;Impiety and blasphemy to hunt<lb/>
him more!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Starbuck, of late I&#x0027;ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever<lb/>
since that hour we both saw&#x2014;thou know&#x0027;st what, in one another&#x0027;s<lb/>
eyes. But in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy<lb/>
face to me as the palm of this hand&#x2014;a lipless, unfeatured blank.<lb/>
Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This whole act&#x0027;s immutably de<lb/>
creed. &#x0027;Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before<lb/>
this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates&#x0027; lieutenant; I act under<lb/>
orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.&#x2014;Stand<lb/>
round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump;<lb/>
leaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. &#x0027;Tis<lb/>
Ahab&#x2014;his body&#x0027;s part; but Ahab&#x0027;s soul&#x0027;s a centipede, that<lb/>
moves upon a hundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as<lb/>
ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so.<lb/>
But ere I break, ye&#x0027;ll hear me crack; and till ye hear <hi rend="i">that</hi>,<lb/>
know that Ahab&#x0027;s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe ye,<lb/>
men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry<lb/>
encore! For ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise<lb/>
to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with<lb/>
Moby Dick&#x2014;two days he&#x0027;s floated&#x2014;to-morrow will be the third.<lb/>
Aye, men, he&#x0027;ll rise once more,&#x2014;but only to spout his last!<lb/>
D&#x0027;ye feel brave men, brave?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;As fearless fire,&#x201D; cried Stubb.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And as mechanical,&#x201D; muttered Ahab. Then as the men<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n658" n="621"/>
went forward, he muttered on:&#x2014;&#x201C;The things called omens!<lb/>
And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there, concerning<lb/>
my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek to drive out of<lb/>
others&#x0027; hearts what&#x0027;s clinched so fast in mine!&#x2014;The Parsee&#x2014;<lb/>
the Parsee!&#x2014;gone, gone? and he was to go before:&#x2014;but still<lb/>
was to be seen again ere I could perish&#x2014;How&#x0027;s that?&#x2014;There&#x0027;s<lb/>
a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts<lb/>
of the whole line of judges:&#x2014;like a hawk&#x0027;s beak it pecks my<lb/>
brain. <hi rend="i">I&#x0027;ll, I&#x0027;ll</hi> solve it, though!&#x201D;</p>
<p>When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.</p>
<p>So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed<lb/>
nearly as on the previous night; only, the sound of hammers,<lb/>
and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight,<lb/>
as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rig-<lb/>
ging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for<lb/>
the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab&#x0027;s wrecked<lb/>
craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the<lb/>
night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his<lb/>
hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial;<lb/>
sat due eastward for the earliest sun.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d135" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER CXXXV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the chase.&#x2014;third day</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and<lb/>
once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was<lb/>
relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every<lb/>
mast and almost every spar.</p>
<p>&#x201C;D&#x0027;ye see him?&#x201D; cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in<lb/>
sight.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that&#x0027;s<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n659" n="622"/>
all. Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going.<lb/>
What a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and<lb/>
made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the<lb/>
first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn<lb/>
upon that world. Here&#x0027;s food for thought, had Ahab time to<lb/>
think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; <hi rend="i">that&#x0027;s</hi><lb/>
tingling enough for mortal man! to think&#x0027;s audacity. God<lb/>
only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be,<lb/>
a coolness and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our<lb/>
poor brains beat too much for that. And yet, I&#x0027;ve sometimes<lb/>
thought my brain was very calm&#x2014;frozen calm, this old skull<lb/>
cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned to ice, and<lb/>
shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment<lb/>
growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it&#x0027;s like that sort<lb/>
of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy<lb/>
clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild<lb/>
winds blow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds<lb/>
of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind<lb/>
that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and<lb/>
cells, and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now<lb/>
comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!&#x2014;<lb/>
it&#x0027;s tainted. Were I the wind, I&#x0027;d blow no more on such a<lb/>
wicked, miserable world. I&#x0027;d crawl somewhere to a cave, and<lb/>
slink there. And yet, &#x0027;tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind!<lb/>
who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and<lb/>
bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run through it.<lb/>
Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not<lb/>
stand to receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing&#x2014;<lb/>
a nobler thing than <hi rend="i">that</hi>. Would now the wind but had a<lb/>
body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage<lb/>
mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless<lb/>
as objects, not as agents. There&#x0027;s a most special, a most cun-<lb/>
ning, oh, a most malicious difference! And yet, I say again,<lb/>
and swear it now, that there&#x0027;s something all glorious and gra-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n660" n="623"/>
cious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least, that in<lb/>
the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast,<lb/>
vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the<lb/>
baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest<lb/>
Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain<lb/>
where to go at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same<lb/>
Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or<lb/>
something like them&#x2014;something so unchangeable, and full as<lb/>
strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there!<lb/>
What d&#x0027;ye see?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nothing, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-beg-<lb/>
ging! See the sun! Aye, aye, it must be so. I&#x0027;ve oversailed<lb/>
him. How, got the start? Aye, he&#x0027;s chasing <hi rend="i">me</hi> now; not<lb/>
I, <hi rend="i">him</hi>&#x2014;that&#x0027;s bad; I might have known it, too. Fool! the<lb/>
lines&#x2014;the harpoons he&#x0027;s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him<lb/>
by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the<lb/>
regular look outs! Man the braces!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat<lb/>
on the Pequod&#x0027;s quarter, so that now being pointed in the<lb/>
reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze<lb/>
as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,&#x201D; mur-<lb/>
mured Starbuck to himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-<lb/>
brace upon the rail. &#x201C;God keep us, but already my bones feel<lb/>
damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh. I mis-<lb/>
doubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stand by to sway me up!&#x201D; cried Ahab, advancing to the<lb/>
hempen basket. &#x201C;We should meet him soon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, sir,&#x201D; and straightway Starbuck did Ahab&#x0027;s bid-<lb/>
ding, and once more Ahab swung on high.</p>
<p>A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time<lb/>
itself now held long breaths with keen suspense. But at last,<lb/>
some three points off the weather bow, Ahab descried the spout<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n661" n="624"/>
again, and instantly from the three mast-heads three shrieks<lb/>
went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby<lb/>
Dick! On deck there!&#x2014;brace sharper up; crowd her into<lb/>
the wind&#x0027;s eye. He&#x0027;s too far off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck.<lb/>
The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman with a top-maul!<lb/>
So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have<lb/>
one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there&#x0027;s time<lb/>
for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye,<lb/>
and not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the<lb/>
sand-hills of Nantucket! The same!&#x2014;the same!&#x2014;the same to<lb/>
Noah as to me. There&#x0027;s a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely<lb/>
leewardings! They must lead somewhere&#x2014;to something else<lb/>
than common land, more palmy than the palms. Leeward!<lb/>
the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the<lb/>
better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye,<lb/>
old mast-head! What&#x0027;s this?&#x2014;green? aye, tiny mosses in these<lb/>
warped cracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab&#x0027;s head!<lb/>
There&#x0027;s the difference now between man&#x0027;s old age and matter&#x0027;s.<lb/>
But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our<lb/>
hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that&#x0027;s all.<lb/>
By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every<lb/>
way. I can&#x0027;t compare with it; and I&#x0027;ve known some ships<lb/>
made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the<lb/>
most vital stuff of vital fathers. What&#x0027;s that he said? he<lb/>
should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen<lb/>
again? But where? Will I have eyes at the bottom of<lb/>
the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all<lb/>
night I&#x0027;ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink<lb/>
to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told&#x0027;st direful truth as<lb/>
touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell<lb/>
short. Good by, mast-head&#x2014;keep a good eye upon the whale,<lb/>
the while I&#x0027;m gone. We&#x0027;ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night,<lb/>
when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n662" n="625"/>
<p>He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily<lb/>
lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck.</p>
<p>In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his<lb/>
shallop&#x0027;s stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent,<lb/>
he waved to the mate,&#x2014;who held one of the tackle-ropes on<lb/>
deck&#x2014;and bade him pause.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Starbuck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;For the third time my soul&#x0027;s ship starts upon this voyage,<lb/>
Starbuck.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are<lb/>
missing, Starbuck!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Truth, sir: saddest truth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at<lb/>
the full of the flood;&#x2014;and I feel now like a billow that&#x0027;s all one<lb/>
crested comb, Starbuck. I am old;&#x2014;shake hands with me, man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck&#x0027;s tears the<lb/>
glue.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, my captain, my captain!&#x2014;noble heart&#x2014;go not&#x2014;go<lb/>
not!&#x2014;see, it&#x0027;s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony<lb/>
of the persuasion then!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lower away!&#x201D;&#x2014;cried Ahab, tossing the mate&#x0027;s arm from<lb/>
him. &#x201C;Stand by the crew!&#x201D;</p>
<p>In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The sharks! the sharks!&#x201D; cried a voice from the low cabin-<lb/>
window there; &#x201C;O master, my master, come back!&#x201D;</p>
<p>But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted<lb/>
then; and the boat leaped on.</p>
<p>Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the<lb/>
ship, when numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the<lb/>
dark waters beneath the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades<lb/>
of the oars, every time they dipped in the water; and in this<lb/>
way accompanied the boat with their bites. It is a thing not<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n663" n="626"/>
uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming<lb/>
seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same<lb/>
prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching<lb/>
regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that had<lb/>
been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been<lb/>
first descried; and whether it was that Ahab&#x0027;s crew were all<lb/>
such tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more<lb/>
musky to the senses of the sharks&#x2014;a matter sometimes well<lb/>
known to affect them,&#x2014;however it was, they seemed to follow<lb/>
that one boat without molesting the others.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Heart of wrought steel!&#x201D; murmured Starbuck gazing over<lb/>
the side, and following with his eyes the receding boat&#x2014;&#x201C;canst<lb/>
thou yet ring boldly to that sight?&#x2014;lowering thy keel among<lb/>
ravening sharks, and followed by them, open-mouthed to the<lb/>
chase; and this the critical third day?&#x2014;For when three days flow<lb/>
together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure the first is<lb/>
the morning, the second the noon, and the third the evening<lb/>
and the end of that thing&#x2014;be that end what it may. Oh! my God!<lb/>
what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so<lb/>
deadly calm, yet expectant,&#x2014;fixed at the top of a shudder!<lb/>
Future things swim before me, as in empty outlines and skele-<lb/>
tons; all the past is somehow grown dim. Mary, girl! thou<lb/>
fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see but thy<lb/>
eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem<lb/>
clearing; but clouds sweep between&#x2014;Is my journey&#x0027;s end<lb/>
coming? My legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day.<lb/>
Feel thy heart,&#x2014;beats it yet?&#x2014;Stir thyself, Starbuck!&#x2014;stave it<lb/>
off&#x2014;move, move! speak aloud!&#x2014;Mast-head there! See ye<lb/>
my boy&#x0027;s hand on the hill?&#x2014;Crazed;&#x2014;aloft there!&#x2014;keep thy<lb/>
keenest eye upon the boats:&#x2014;mark well the whale!&#x2014;Ho!<lb/>
again!&#x2014;drive off that hawk! see! he pecks&#x2014;he tears the<lb/>
vane&#x201D;&#x2014;pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;Ha! he soars away with it!&#x2014;Where&#x0027;s the old man now?<lb/>
sees&#x0027;t thou that sight, oh Ahab!&#x2014;shudder, shudder!&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n664" n="627"/>
<p>The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the<lb/>
mast-heads&#x2014;a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale<lb/>
had sounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he<lb/>
held on his way a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed<lb/>
crew maintaining the profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves<lb/>
hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost<lb/>
heads drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and<lb/>
no coffin and no hearse can be mine:&#x2014;and hemp only can kill<lb/>
me! Ha! ha!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad<lb/>
circles; then quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a<lb/>
submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising to the surface. A low<lb/>
rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum; and then all<lb/>
held their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and har-<lb/>
poons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely<lb/>
from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it<lb/>
hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamp-<lb/>
ing back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the<lb/>
waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly<lb/>
sank in a shower of flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed<lb/>
like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Give way!&#x201D; cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted<lb/>
forward to the attack; but maddened by yesterday&#x0027;s fresh irons<lb/>
that corroded in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed<lb/>
by all the angels that fell from heaven. The wide tiers of<lb/>
welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath<lb/>
the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he<lb/>
came churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed<lb/>
them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two<lb/>
mates&#x0027; boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their<lb/>
bows, but leaving Ahab&#x0027;s almost without a scar.</p>
<p>While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained<lb/>
planks; and as the whale swimming out from them, turned,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n665" n="628"/>
and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again; at that<lb/>
moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and round to the<lb/>
fish&#x0027;s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during<lb/>
the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines<lb/>
around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his<lb/>
sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full<lb/>
upon old Ahab.</p>
<p>The harpoon dropped from his hand.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Befooled, befooled!&#x201D;&#x2014;drawing in a long lean breath&#x2014;&#x201C;Aye,<lb/>
Parsee! I see thee again.&#x2014;Aye, and thou goest before; and<lb/>
this, <hi rend="i">this</hi> then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold<lb/>
thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse?<lb/>
Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair<lb/>
them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is<lb/>
enough to die&#x2014;Down, men! the first thing that but offers to<lb/>
jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are<lb/>
not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.&#x2014;<lb/>
Where&#x0027;s the whale? gone down again?&#x201D;</p>
<p>But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping<lb/>
with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the<lb/>
last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby<lb/>
Dick was now again steadily swimming forward; and had<lb/>
almost passed the ship,&#x2014;which thus far had been sailing in the<lb/>
contrary direction to him, though for the present her headway<lb/>
had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost<lb/>
velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight<lb/>
path in the sea.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! Ahab,&#x201D; cried Starbuck, &#x201C;not too late is it, even now,<lb/>
the third day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It<lb/>
is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly<lb/>
impelled to leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last<lb/>
when Ahab was sliding by the vessel, so near as plainly to dis-<lb/>
tinguish Starbuck&#x0027;s face as he leaned over the rail, he hailed<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n666" n="629"/>
him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not too swiftly,<lb/>
at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he saw Tashtego,<lb/>
Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-<lb/>
heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats<lb/>
which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at<lb/>
work in repairing them. One after the other, through the port-<lb/>
holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and<lb/>
Flask, busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons<lb/>
and lances. As he saw all this; as he heard the hammers in<lb/>
the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving a nail into<lb/>
his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or<lb/>
flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tas-<lb/>
htego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for<lb/>
another flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.</p>
<p>Whether fagged by the three days&#x0027; running chase, and the<lb/>
resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or<lb/>
whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him:<lb/>
whichever was true, the White Whale&#x0027;s way now began to abate,<lb/>
as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more;<lb/>
though indeed the whale&#x0027;s last start had not been so long a one<lb/>
as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying<lb/>
sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the<lb/>
boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades<lb/>
became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea,<lb/>
at almost every dip.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your<lb/>
oars. Pull on! &#x0027;tis the better rest, the shark&#x0027;s jaw than the<lb/>
yielding water.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and<lb/>
smaller!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They will last long enough! pull on!&#x2014;But who can tell&#x201D;&#x2014;<lb/>
he muttered&#x2014;&#x201C;whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale<lb/>
or on Ahab?&#x2014;But pull on! Aye, all alive, now&#x2014;we near him.<lb/>
The helm! take the helm; let me pass,&#x201D;&#x2014;and so saying, two<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n667" n="630"/>
of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying<lb/>
boat.</p>
<p>At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging<lb/>
along with the White Whale&#x0027;s flank, he seemed strangely<lb/>
oblivious of its advance&#x2014;as the whale sometimes will&#x2014;and<lb/>
Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist, which,<lb/>
thrown off from the whale&#x0027;s spout, curled round his great,<lb/>
Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when, with<lb/>
body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the<lb/>
poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the<lb/>
hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if<lb/>
sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodi-<lb/>
cally rolled his nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving<lb/>
a hole in it, so suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not<lb/>
been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then<lb/>
clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea.<lb/>
As it was, three of the oarsmen&#x2014;who foreknew not the precise<lb/>
instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its effects&#x2014;<lb/>
these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of them<lb/>
clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing<lb/>
wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man<lb/>
helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungradu-<lb/>
ated, instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through<lb/>
the weltering sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman<lb/>
to take new turns with the line, and hold it so; and commanded<lb/>
the crew to turn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to<lb/>
the mark; the moment the treacherous line felt that double<lb/>
strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!</p>
<p>&#x201C;What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!&#x2014;&#x0027;tis whole<lb/>
again; oars! oars! Burst in upon him!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the<lb/>
whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but<lb/>
in that evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n668" n="631"/>
ship; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions;<lb/>
bethinking it&#x2014;it may be&#x2014;a larger and nobler foe; of a sud-<lb/>
den, he bore down upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws<lb/>
amid fiery showers of foam.</p>
<p>Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. &#x201C;I grow<lb/>
blind; hands! stretch out before me that I may yet grope my<lb/>
way. Is&#x0027;t night?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The whale! The ship!&#x201D; cried the cringing oarsmen.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that<lb/>
ere it be for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time<lb/>
upon his mark! I see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men!<lb/>
Will ye not save my ship?&#x201D;</p>
<p>But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the<lb/>
sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of<lb/>
two planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the tempo-<lb/>
rarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-<lb/>
wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out<lb/>
the pouring water.</p>
<p>Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego&#x0027;s mast-<lb/>
head hammer remained suspended in his hand; and the red<lb/>
flag, half-wrapping him as with a plaid, then streamed itself<lb/>
straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing heart; while<lb/>
Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught<lb/>
sight of the down-coming monster just as soon as he.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye<lb/>
sweet powers of air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die,<lb/>
if die he must, in a woman&#x0027;s fainting fit Up helm, I say&#x2014;ye<lb/>
fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is this the end of all my bursting<lb/>
prayers? all my life-long fidelities? Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy<lb/>
work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up helm<lb/>
again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow<lb/>
drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart.<lb/>
My God, stand by me now!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n669" n="632"/>
that will now help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at<lb/>
thee, thou grinning whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb<lb/>
awake, but Stubb&#x0027;s own unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb<lb/>
goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would it were<lb/>
stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale!<lb/>
Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of as good<lb/>
a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would<lb/>
yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh!<lb/>
oh, oh! thou grinning whale, but there &#x0027;ll be plenty of gulping<lb/>
soon! Why fly ye not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and<lb/>
jacket to it; let Stubb die in his drawers! A most mouldy and<lb/>
over salted death, though;&#x2014;cherries! cherries! cherries! Oh,<lb/>
Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh,<lb/>
Stubb, I hope my poor mother&#x0027;s drawn my part-pay ere this;<lb/>
if not, few coppers will now come to her, for the voyage is up.&#x201D;</p>
<p>From the ship&#x0027;s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung<lb/>
inactive; hammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mecha-<lb/>
nically retained in their hands, just as they had darted from their<lb/>
various employments; all their enchanted eyes intent upon the<lb/>
whale, which from side to side strangely vibrating his predesti-<lb/>
nating head, sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam<lb/>
before him as he rushed. Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal<lb/>
malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man<lb/>
could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the<lb/>
ship&#x0027;s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell<lb/>
flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the<lb/>
harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the<lb/>
breach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The ship! The hearse!&#x2014;the second hearse!&#x201D; cried Ahab<lb/>
from the boat; &#x201C;its wood could only be American!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering<lb/>
along its keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the sur-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n670" n="633"/>
face again, far off the other bow, but within a few yards of<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s boat, where, for a time, he lay quiescent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let<lb/>
me hear thy hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of<lb/>
mine; thou uncracked keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou<lb/>
firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,&#x2014;death-<lb/>
glorious ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am I<lb/>
cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked cap-<lb/>
tains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my<lb/>
topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all<lb/>
your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my<lb/>
whole foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death!<lb/>
Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale;<lb/>
to the last I grapple with thee; from hell&#x0027;s heart I stab at<lb/>
thee; for hate&#x0027;s sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all<lb/>
coffins and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither<lb/>
can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee,<lb/>
though tied to thee, thou damned whale! <hi rend="i">Thus</hi>, I give up the<lb/>
spear!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward;<lb/>
with igniting velocity the line ran through the groove;&#x2014;ran<lb/>
foul. Ahab stooped to clear it; he did clear it; but the flying<lb/>
turn caught him round the neck, and voicelessly as Turkish<lb/>
mutes bowstring their victim, he was shot out of the boat, ere<lb/>
the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the heavy eye-<lb/>
splice in the rope&#x0027;s final end flew out of the stark-empty tub,<lb/>
knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in<lb/>
its depths.</p>
<p>For an instant, the tranced boat&#x0027;s crew stood still; then<lb/>
turned. &#x201C;The ship? Great God, where is the ship?&#x201D; Soon<lb/>
they through dim, bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fa-<lb/>
ding phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana; only the upper-<lb/>
most masts out of water; while fixed by infatuation, or fidelity,<lb/>
or fate, to their once lofty perches, the pagan harpooneers still<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n671" n="634"/>
maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea. And now, con-<lb/>
centric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its crew, and<lb/>
each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate<lb/>
and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the<lb/>
smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.</p>
<p>But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves<lb/>
over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a<lb/>
few inches of the erect spar yet visible, together with long<lb/>
streaming yards of the flag, which calmly undulated, with<lb/>
ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost<lb/>
touched;&#x2014;at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered<lb/>
backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the<lb/>
flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk<lb/>
that tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from<lb/>
its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and<lb/>
incommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to inter-<lb/>
cept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the<lb/>
wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill, the sub-<lb/>
merged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer<lb/>
frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks,<lb/>
and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive<lb/>
form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship,<lb/>
which, like Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged<lb/>
a living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted herself<lb/>
with it.</p>
<p>Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf;<lb/>
a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed,<lb/>
and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thou-<lb/>
sand years ago.</p>

who, when on the last day the three men were tossed from out<lb/>

margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the<lb/>
half-spent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but<lb/>
slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it,<lb/>
it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then,<lb/>
and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the<lb/>
axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did<lb/>
revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble<lb/>
upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning<lb/>
spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force,<lb/>
the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and<lb/>
floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one<lb/>

<p>White-Jacket will find (since it deserves to find) many animated and interested<lb/>
readers. Mr. Melville stands as far apart from any past or present marine painter<lb/>
in pen and ink as Turner does from Vandervelde. We can not recall another nov-<lb/>
elist or sketcher who has given the poetry of the ship, her voyages, and her crew,<lb/>
in a manner at all resembling his.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Athenaum.</hi></p>
<p>The characters brought upon the stage are admirable life-pictures, exhibiting by<lb/>
the magic effect of a few masterly touches each man in the complete individuality<lb/>
of his person and his office, from the commodore, who, as he paces the quarter-deck,<lb/>
covers up his deficiency in the qualities necessary for command by the unblending<lb/>
starchness of official etiquette, down to the meanest specimen of the genus loblolly-<lb/>
oy.&#x2014; <hi rend="i">John Bull.</hi></p>
<p>Had not Mr. Melville already appeared before the world with productions which,<lb/>
by their powerful energy and general worth, have won both attention and admira-<lb/>
tion, this work would be sufficient to establish him as a substantial favorite for the<lb/>
future. Whatever he writes upon, he writes on it well, and throughout his pages,<lb/>
open them where you may, will be found, amid a host of beauties and singularities,<lb/>
the strongest evidence of an untiring spirit, great vigor, lofty imagination, and a pure<lb/>
style of writing. The perusal of it has caused us so much real and sterling pleasure,<lb/>
that we feel it a duty we owe both to its author and the public to recommend it to<lb/>
the latter in the strongest manner.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Morning Post.</hi></p>
<p>Many of the wonders of the world of a man-of-war are now revealed to us for the<lb/>
first time. The whole narrative is marked by all the sobriety of truth, and, though<lb/>
enlivened by the sparkling and racy style which characterizes the author in his hap-<lb/>
piest moments, is full of those details which bear with them the conviction that the<lb/>
scene is sketched from the life.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Atlas.</hi></p>
<p>Varied as are the pictures which Herman Melville here presents to us, the same<lb/>
natural delineation of a master-hand is visible in them all, and few who have fol-<lb/>
lowed its momentous career will arrive without regret at the chapter which records<lb/>
&#x201C;the end of the Jacket.&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Sun.</hi></p>
<p>We have called Mr. Melville a common sailor, but he is a very uncommon com-<lb/>
mon sailor, even for America, whose mariners are better educated than our own.<lb/>
His descriptions of scenery are life-like and vigorous, sometimes masterly, and his<lb/>
style throughout is rather that of an educated literary man than of a working sea-<lb/>
man.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Times.</hi></p>
<p>Brilliant and dashingly spirited descriptions abound in this volume. It is writ-<lb/>
ten in the author&#x0027;s best style; and no modern author ranks higher as a marine<lb/>
painter. The mysteries of life on ship-board are revealed, and the abuses of the<lb/>
service freely commented on.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Baltimore American.</hi></p>
<p>It is full of humor and keen satire, and it ought to have a good effect in reforming<lb/>
some of the abuses in our navy.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Norfolk Democrat.</hi></p>

<p>Let Mr. Melville write as much as he will, provided always he writes as well as<lb/>
now, and he shall find us greedy devourers of his productions. He has a rare pen<lb/>
for the delineation of character; an eye for the humorous and grotesque which is<lb/>
worth a Jew&#x0027;s; for the description of natural scenery he is not to be beaten, either<lb/>
on this side of the Atlantic or the other. His pencil is most distinct, the coloring<lb/>
beautiful and rich. As for invention, he will bear comparison with the most cun-<lb/>
ning of the modern French school. &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; At the last page of his second work, Mr.<lb/>
Melville is as fresh and vigorous as at the first line of the book which preceded it.<lb/>
Lkie his reader, he leaves off with an appetite.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Times.</hi></p>
<p>Unlike most sequels, Omoo is equal to its predecessor. The character of the com-<lb/>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine a man better fitted to describe the impressions such<lb/>

<p>A work such as was never heard of before. You might accumulate upon it all<lb/>
the epithets which Madame de Sevign&#x00E9; affectionated. Fancy Daphnis and Chloe<lb/>
dancing I know not what strange <hi rend="i">gavotte</hi> with Aristotle and Spinoza, escorted by<lb/>
Gargantua and Gargamelle. Mardi is the modern political world. This part is the<lb/>
most piquant of the book. The colossal machine invented by Mr. Melville might<lb/>
be compared to the American Panorama now placarded on the walls of London in<lb/>
these terms: &#x201C;<hi rend="i">Gigantic original American Panorama, now on exhibition in the great<lb/>
American Hall; the prodigious moving Panorama of the Gulf of<lb/>
Mexico, the Falls of St. Anthony, and of the Mississippi, covering an extent of canvass four miles long, and<lb/>
representing more than</hi> 4000 <hi rend="i">miles of scencry.&#x201D; Translated from the &#x201C;Revue de Deux<lb/>
Mondes.</hi>&#x201D;</p>
<p>From the first chapter of the book to the last, where the hero is swept from our<lb/>
sight in a cloud of spray, the book is a magnificent drama.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Bentley&#x0027;s Miscellany</hi></p>
<p>Mardi is a purely original invention, an extraordinary book. It is a species of Uto-<lb/>
pia, or, rather, a sea voyage in which we discover human nature. There is a world<lb/>
of poetical, thoughtful, ingenious, moral writing in it, exhibiting the most various re-<lb/>
flection and reading. Is it not significant that we should soon be swept beyond the<lb/>
current of the isles into this world of high discourse&#x2014;revolving the conditions, the<lb/>
duties, and destinies of men?&#x2014;<hi rend="i">New York Literary World.</hi></p>
<p>Mardi has posed us. It has struck our head like one of those blows which set<lb/>
every thing dancing and glancing before your eyes like splintered sun&#x0027;s rays. The<lb/>
images are brilliant; the adventures superb.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Literary Gazette.</hi></p>

<p>Mardi is full of all Oriental delights.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Home Journal.</hi></p>
<p>The reader who has business in Mardi will find it rich in wisdom and brilliant with<lb/>
beauty. It is a magnificent allegory, wherein the world is seen as in a mirror. The<lb/>
germ of the oak is not more surely hid in the acorn than Melville&#x0027;s fame in this book.<lb/>
&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Chronotype.</hi></p>
<p>An extraordinary production. Mardi is the world.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Musical Times.</hi></p>

kind.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Blackwood.</hi></p>
<p>A sort of retina picture, or inverted view of the world, under the name of Mardi.<lb/>
Typee and Omoo are to this work as a seven-by-nine sketch of a sylvan lake with a<lb/>
lone hunter, or a boy fishing, compared with the cartoons of Raphael.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Dem. Rev.</hi></p>
<p>A wonderful book; at once enthusiastic and epigrammatic; it burns at one and<lb/>
the same time with an intense and richly colored glow of poetic ardor, and the more<lb/>
glittering, but paler fires of an artful rhetoric.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Morning Chronicle.</hi></p>

<p>&#x201C;Why I never chanced upon Mr. Melville&#x0027;s work before, is one of the inscrutable<lb/>
mysteries of my fate. While luxuriating in its perusal, I looked back upon myself<lb/>
in my ante-Typee-cal existence, with positive commiseration. There are those, I<lb/>
am aware, who doubt the authenticity of this charming narrative. &#x2018;Oh, ye of little<lb/>
faith!&#x2019; I have a solemn conviction of its truth&#x2014;a pertinacious belief in the entire<lb/>
work&#x2014;an humble, unquestioning reliance on the word of the narrator.&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Corre-<lb/>

<p>Typee is a happy hit, whichever way you look at it&#x2014;whether as travels, romance,<lb/>
poetry, or humor. The <hi rend="i">bonhommie</hi> of the book is remarkable. It appears as genial<lb/>
and natural as the spontaneous fruits of the island.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Morning News.</hi></p>
<p>The air of freshness and romance which characterizes Typee, gives it the appear-<lb/>
ance of an improved edition of our old favorites, Peter Wilkins and Gulliver.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Rich-<lb/>

<p>A charming book&#x2014;full of talent, composed with singular elegance, and as musical<lb/>

<p>Enviable Herman! A happier dog it is impossible to imagine than Herman in<lb/>
the Typee valley.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Times.</hi></p>
<p>Some of these pictures but require us to call the savages celestials, to have sup-<lb/>
posed Mr. Melville to have dropped from the clouds, and to fancy some Ovidian<lb/>
grace added to the narrative in order to become scenes of classic mythology.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Lon-<lb/>

<p>Such is life in the valley of the Typees; and surely Rasselas, if he had had the good<lb/>
luck to stumble on it, would not have gone further in his search after happiness.&#x2014;<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Douglas Jerrold&#x0027;s Magazine.</hi></p>
<p>The whole narrative is most simple, most affecting, and most romantic. Ah! thou<lb/>
gentle and too enchanting Fayaway, what has become of thee?&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Lon. Gent&#x0027;s. Mag.</hi></p>
<p>Since the joyous moment when we first read Robinson Crusoe, and believed it all<lb/>
and wondered all the more because we believed, we have not met with so bewitch-<lb/>

<p>A book full of fresh and richly-colored matter.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Athenaum.</hi></p>
<p>This is really a very curious book. The happy valley of our dear Rasselas was<lb/>
not a more romantic or enchanting scene.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Examiner.</hi></p>
<p>This is a most entertaining and refreshing book. The writer, though filling the<lb/>
post of a common sailor, is certainly no common man.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Critic.</hi></p>
<p>The style is racy and pointed, and there is a romantic interest thrown around the<lb/>
adventure, which to most readers will be highly charming.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">American Review.</hi></p>
<p>It bears the unexhausted characteristics of talent.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">National Intelligencer.</hi></p>

<p>Ships and the sea, and those who plow it, with their belongings on shore&#x2014;these<lb/>
subjects are identified with Herman Melville&#x0027;s name, for he has most unquestiona-<lb/>
bly made them his own. No writer, not even Marryat himself, has observed them<lb/>
more closely or pictured them more impressively.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Albion.</hi></p>
<p>A delightful book. A quiet vein of humor runs through it that will better repay<lb/>
the exploring than many of the veins will gold-digging.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Courier.</hi></p>
<p>It is unquestionably a work of genius, and quite as interesting as it is unique; and<lb/>
we know not where a better idea of sailor life can be found than in its pages.&#x2014;<lb/>
<hi rend="i">National Intelligencer.</hi></p>
<p>As perfect a specimen of the naval yarn as we ever read, and displays much va-<lb/>
rious talent and power. The characters are exceedingly well drawn.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">London Lit-<lb/>
erary Gazette.</hi></p>
<p>This book is intensely interesting. The great charm of the work is its realness.<lb/>
It seems to be <hi rend="i">fact</hi>, word for word. The tale is told simply and without the least pre-<lb/>
tension; and yet, within its bounds, are flashes of genuine humor, strokes of pure<lb/>
pathos and real and original characters.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Boston Post.</hi></p>
<p>The life-like manner in which every event is brought to the reader is astonishing.<lb/>
&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Home Journal.</hi></p>
<p>This book is in the old vein. It is written for the million, and the million will<lb/>
doubtless be delighted with its racy descriptions of the life of a young sailor.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Noah&#x0027;s<lb/>

<p>Redburn is a clever book. &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; All who have read &#x201C;Omoo&#x201D; will remember that<lb/>
the author is an adept in the sketching of beautiful originals.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Blackwood&#x0027;s Magazine.</hi></p>
<p>The freshness and rich coloring of his writings, with his easy and pointed style,<lb/>
his humor and descriptions of scenery and character, have earned for him the name<lb/>
of the Defoe of the Sea.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Baltimore American.</hi></p>
<p>Redburn will prove a most readable book.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Richmond Whig.</hi></p>
<p>The style of the book is exceedingly attractive. In our view it has higher merits<lb/>
than any other volume from the same pen.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Hartford Republican.</hi></p>
<p>Redburn is no ordinary book. If an imaginary narrative, it is the most life-like,<lb/>
natural fiction since Robinson Crusoe.&#x2014;<hi rend="i">Southern Literary Messenger.</hi></p>
<p>In the filling up there is a simplicity, an ease, which may win the attention of a<lb/>

<p>The author of this volume needs no commendation. He has already found his<lb/>
audience, and it is not wanting in numbers, in taste, in discrimination. No writer<lb/>
