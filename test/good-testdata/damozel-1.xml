<notes>This is the only complete holograph MS of the poem. It was copied out by Rossetti and given to Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning in 1855 as a present. On Monday, 1 October 1855, DGR wrote to Elizabeth Barrett Browning: “I copied out that old production of mine, &amp; now enclose it. It has gained some value in my eyes since Mr. Browning quoted two lines of it. It was written long ago, but has been very little altered since except by omission ” Fredeman, Correspondance, vol.2, 69 ).

<m_s id="page1line1" type="l." n="1" />The blessed damsel leaned against<m_e refid="page1line1" />
<m_s id="page1line2" type="l." n="2" /> The silver bar of Heaven.<m_e refid="page1line2" />
<m_s id="page1line3" type="l." n="3" />Her eyes knew more of rest and shade<m_e refid="page1line3" />
<m_s id="page1line4" type="l." n="4" /> Than a deep water, even–<m_e refid="page1line4" />
<m_s id="page1line5" type="l." n="5" />She had three lilies in her hand<m_e refid="page1line5" />
<m_s id="page1line6" type="l." n="6" /> And the stars in her hair were seven.<m_e refid="page1line6" />
<m_s id="page1stanza2" type="st." n="2" /><m_e refid="page1stanza1" />
<m_s id="page1line7" type="l." n="7" />Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,<m_e refid="page1line7" />
<m_s id="page1line8" type="l." n="8" /> No wrought flowers did adorn,<m_e refid="page1line8" />
<m_s id="page1line9" type="l." n="9" />But a white robe of Mary's gift<m_e refid="page1line9" />
<m_s id="page1line10" type="l." n="10" /> For service meetly worn;<m_e refid="page1line10" />
<m_s id="page1line11" type="l." n="11" />And her hair lying down her back<m_e refid="page1line11" />
<m_s id="page1line12" type="l." n="12" /> Was yellow like ripe corn.<m_e refid="page1line12" />
<m_s id="page1stanza3" type="st." n="3" /><m_e refid="page1stanza2" />
<m_s id="page1line13" type="l." n="13" />Herseemed she scarce had been a day<m_e refid="page1line13" />
<m_s id="page1line14" type="l." n="14" /> One of God's choristers;<m_e refid="page1line14" />
<m_s id="page1line15" type="l." n="15" />The wonder was not yet quite gone<m_e refid="page1line15" />
<m_s id="page1line16" type="l." n="16" /> From that still look of hers;<m_e refid="page1line16" />
<m_s id="page1line17" type="l." n="17" />Albeit to them she left, her day<m_e refid="page1line17" />
<m_s id="page1line18" type="l." n="18" /> Had counted as ten years.<m_e refid="page1line18" />
<m_s id="page1stanza4" type="st." n="4" /><m_e refid="page1stanza3" />
<m_s id="page1line19" type="l." n="19" />(To one it is ten years of years.<m_e refid="page1line19" />
<m_s id="page1line20" type="l." n="20" /> . . . . . Yet now, and in This place,<m_e refid="page1line20" />
<m_s id="page1line21" type="l." n="21" />Surely she leaned o'er me,—her hair<m_e refid="page1line21" />
<m_s id="page1line22" type="l." n="22" /> Fell all about my face.<m_e refid="page1line22" />
<m_s id="page1line23" type="l." n="23" />Nothing: the autumn fall of leaves:<m_e refid="page1line23" />
<m_s id="page1line24" type="l." n="24" /> The whole year sets apace.)<m_e refid="page1line24" />
<m_s id="page1stanza5" type="st." n="5" /><m_e refid="page1stanza4" />
<m_s id="page1line25" type="l." n="25" />It was the rampart of God's house<m_e refid="page1line25" />
<m_s id="page1line26" type="l." n="26" /> That she was standing on;<m_e refid="page1line26" />
<m_s id="page1line27" type="l." n="27" />By God built over that sheer depth<m_e refid="page1line27" />
<m_s id="page1line28" type="l." n="28" /> The which is Space begun;<m_e refid="page1line28" />
<m_s id="page1line29" type="l." n="29" />So high, that looking downward thence,<m_e refid="page1line29" />
<m_s id="page1line30" type="l." n="30" /> She scarce could see The Sun.<m_e refid="page1line30" />
<m_s id="page1stanza6" type="st." n="6" /><m_e refid="page1stanza5" />
<m_s id="page1line31" type="l." n="31" />Heard hardly, some of her new friends,<m_e refid="page1line31" />
<m_s id="page1line32" type="l." n="32" /> Playing at holy games,<m_e refid="page1line32" />
<m_s id="page1line33" type="l." n="33" />Spake gentle-mouthed among themselves<m_e refid="page1line33" />
<m_s id="page1line34" type="l." n="34" /> Their virginal chaste names;<m_e refid="page1line34" />
<m_s id="page1line35" type="l." n="35" />And the souls mounting up to God<m_e refid="page1line35" />
<m_s id="page1line36" type="l." n="36" /> Went by her like thin flames.<m_e refid="page1line36" />
<m_s id="page1stanza7" type="st." n="7" /><m_e refid="page1stanza6" />
<m_s id="page1line37" type="l." n="37" />And still she bowed herself &amp; stooped<m_e refid="page1line37" />
<m_s id="page1line38" type="l." n="38" /> Into the vast waste calm,<m_e refid="page1line38" />
<m_s id="page1line39" type="l." n="39" />Till her bosom's pressure must have made<m_e refid="page1line39" />
<m_s id="page1line40" type="l." n="40" /> The bar she leaned on warm,<m_e refid="page1line40" />
<m_s id="page1line41" type="l." n="41" />And the lilies lay as if asleep<m_e refid="page1line41" />
<m_s id="page1line42" type="l." n="42" /> Along her bended arm.<m_e refid="page1line42" />
<m_s id="page1stanza8" type="st." n="8" /><m_e refid="page1stanza7" />
<m_s id="page1line43" type="l." n="43" />From the fixt lull of Heaven, she saw<m_e refid="page1line43" />
<m_s id="page1line44" type="l." n="44" /> Time like a pulse shake fierce<m_e refid="page1line44" />
<m_s id="page1line45" type="l." n="45" />Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove<m_e refid="page1line45" />
<m_s id="page1line46" type="l." n="46" /> Within that gulf to pierce<m_e refid="page1line46" />
<m_s id="page1line47" type="l." n="47" />The swarm; and then she spake, as when<m_e refid="page1line47" />
<m_s id="page1line48" type="l." n="48" /> The stars sang in their spheres.<m_e refid="page1line48" />
<m_s id="page1stanza9" type="st." n="9" /><m_e refid="page1stanza8" />

<m_s id="page1line50" type="l." n="50" /> For he will come,” she said.<m_e refid="page1line50" />
<m_s id="page1line51" type="l." n="51" />“Have I not prayed in Heaven?— on earth,<m_e refid="page1line51" />
<m_s id="page1line52" type="l." n="52" /> Lord, Lord, has he not prayed?<m_e refid="page1line52" />
<m_s id="page1line53" type="l." n="53" />Are not two prayers a perfect strength?<m_e refid="page1line53" />
<m_s id="page1line54" type="l." n="54" /> And shall I feel afraid?<m_e refid="page1line54" />

<m_s id="page1line55" type="l." n="55" />“When round his head the aureole clings<m_e refid="page1line55" />

<m_s id="page1line57" type="l." n="57" />I'll take his hand and go with him<m_e refid="page1line57" />
<m_s id="page1line58" type="l." n="58" /> To the deep wells of light,<m_e refid="page1line58" />
<m_s id="page1line59" type="l." n="59" />And we will step down as to a stream<m_e refid="page1line59" />
<m_s id="page1line60" type="l." n="60" /> And bathe there in God's sight.<m_e refid="page1line60" />

<m_s id="page1line61" type="l." n="61" />“We two will stand beside that shrine,<m_e refid="page1line61" />

<m_s id="page1line63" type="l." n="63" />Whose lamps are stirred continually<m_e refid="page1line63" />
<m_s id="page1line64" type="l." n="64" /> With prayers sent up to God;<m_e refid="page1line64" />
<m_s id="page1line65" type="l." n="65" />And see our own prayers, granted, melt<m_e refid="page1line65" />
<m_s id="page1line66" type="l." n="66" /> Each like a little cloud.<m_e refid="page1line66" />

<m_s id="page1line71" type="l." n="71" />While every leaf that His plumes touch<m_e refid="page1line71" />
