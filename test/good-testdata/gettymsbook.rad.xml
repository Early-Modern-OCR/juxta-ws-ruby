						            <p n="1">Among my earliest recollections, none is stronger than that of my <lb/>father standing before the
							fire when he came home in the London <lb/>winter evening, and singing to us, in his sweet generous tones:
							some- <lb/>time ancient ditties of our own country&#8212;such songs as one might translate from
							<lb/>the birds, and the brooks might set to music; sometimes <del>foreign songs</del>
							              <add>those</add> with <lb/>which <add>foreign</add> travel had familiarized his youth,&#8212;among
							them the great <lb/>tunes which have rung the world's changes since '89. I used to sit on <lb/>the <del>carpet</del>
							              <add>hearth-rug</add>, listening to him, and look between his knees into the <lb/>fire till it burned my
							face, while the <del>shapes</del> sights swarming up in it seemed <lb/>changed <add>and changed</add> with
							the music: till the music and the fire and <lb/>my heart burned together, and I would take paper and
							pencil, and try <lb/>to fix the shapes that rose within me. For my <lb/>hope was to be a painter.</p>
						            <epage/>
						            <page n="[25/2]" image="a."/>
						            <p n="2">The first book I remember to have read of my own accord was <lb/>an old-fashioned work on Art which
							my mother had,&#8212;&#8220;Hamilton's <lb/>English Conoscente.&#8221; It was a kind of
							continental tour,&#8212;sufficiently <lb/>Della-Cruscan, from what I can recall of it,&#8212;and
							contained notices <lb/>of works of art which the author had seen abroad, with engravings after <lb/>some
							of them. These were in the English fashion of that day, executed <lb/>in dots and printed with red ink;
							tasteless enough, no doubt, but <lb/>I yearned towards them, and would toil over them for days. One
							<lb/>especially possessed for me a strong and indefinable charm: <del>it</del> it was <lb/>a Saint Agnes
							in glory, by Bucciolo d'Orli Angiolieri. This plate <lb/>I could copy from the first with much more
							success than I could any <lb/>of the others; indeed, it was mainly my love of the figure, and a
							<lb/>desire to obtain some knowledge regarding it, which impelled me, <lb/>by one magnanimous effort upon
							the &#8220;Conoscente,&#8221; to master in a <lb/>few days more of the difficult art of reading
							than my mother's laborious <lb/>inculcations had accomplished during a year or two. However, what I
							managed <lb/>to spell and puzzle out related chiefly to the executive qualities of <lb/>the picture, which
							could be little understood by a mere <del>boy</del>
							              <add>child</add>; of the<epage/>
							              <page n="[26/3]" image="a."/>
							              <lb/>artist himself, or the meaning of his work, the author of the book <lb/>appeared to know scarcely anything.</p>
						            <p n="3">As I became older, my boyish impulse towards art grew into a <lb/>vital passion; till at last my
							father took me from school and per- <lb/>mitted me my own bent of study. There is no need that I should
							<lb/>dwell much upon the few next years of my life. The beginnings of <lb/>Art, entered on at all
							seriously, present an alternation of extremes:&#8212; <lb/>on the one hand, the most bewildering
							phases of mental endeavour, <lb/>on the other, a toil rigidly &amp; exact dealing often with trifles.
							What <lb/>was then the precise shape of the cloud within my tabernacle, I could <lb/>scarcely say now; or
							whether indeed I knew its form through so thick a veil or could be sure <lb/>of its presence there at all;
							and as to which statue at the Museum <lb/>I drew most &#8212; or learned least from,&#8212;or
							which Professor at the Academy <lb/>&#8220;set&#8221; the model in the worst
							taste,&#8212;these are things which no one <lb/>need care to know. I may say here that I was wayward
							enough <lb/> in the pursuit, if not in the purpose; that I cared even too little for <lb/>what could be
							taught me by others; and that my original designs <lb/>
							              <del>were much</del>
							              <add>greatly</add> outnumbered my school-drawings.</p>
						            <epage/>
						            <page n="[27/4]" image="a."/>
						            <p n="4">In most cases where study (such study, at least, as involves any <lb/>practical elements) has
							benumbed that subtle transition which brings <lb/>youth out of boyhood; there <del>is</del>
							              <add>comes</add> a point, after some while, when <lb/>the mind loses its suppleness, and being riveted
							merely by the continuance <lb/>of the mechanical effort, the constrained senses <lb/>gradually assume
							their utmost tension, and any urgent impression <lb/>from without will suffice to scatter the spell. The
							student looks <lb/>up: the film of their own fixedness drops at once from before his eyes, <lb/>and for
							the first time he sees his life in the face.</p>
						            <p n="5">In my twentieth year, I might say that between one path of Art <lb/>and another, I worked hard. One
							afternoon I was returning, after <lb/>an unprofitable morning, from a class for the model which I
							attended; the day <lb/>was one of those oppressive lulls in autumn, when application, unless <lb/>under
							sustained excitement, is all but impossible,&#8212;when the <del>senses</del>
							              <add>perceptions</add>
							              <lb/>seem curdled and the brain full of sand. On ascending the stairs to <lb/>my room, I heard voices
							there, and when I entered, found my sister <lb/>Catharine, with another young lady, busily turning over my
							sketches <lb/>and papers, as if in search of something. Catharine laughed, and <lb/>introduced her
							companion as Miss Mary Ethell. There might have <lb/>been a little malice in the laugh, for I remembered
							to have heard <lb/>the lady's <epage/>
							              <page n="[28/5]" image="a."/>
							              <lb/>name before, and to have then made in fun some teasing <lb/>inquiries about her, as one will of one's
							sisters' friends. I bowed for <lb/>the introduction, and stood rebuked. She had her back to the
							windowwhere the light was strong, <lb/>and I could not well see her features at the moment; but I made
							sure <lb/>she was very beautiful, from the way that <lb/>she held her hands and her tranquil body.
							Catharine told me they had been looking together <lb/>for a book of hers which I had had by me for some
							time, and which <lb/>she had promised to Miss Ethell. I joined in the search, the book <lb/>was found, and
							soon after they left my room. I had come in utterly <lb/>spiritless; but now I fell to and worked well for
							several hours. In <lb/>the evening, when I went down stairs to the family, I found Miss Ethell still with
							them; she remained rather <lb/>late: till she left I did not return to my room, nor, when there, was
							<lb/>my work resumed that night. I had thought her more beautiful <lb/>than at first.</p>
						            <p n="6">For <del>some months</del> about a year after this I am afraid I <lb/>neglected my studies almost
							entirely, except so ,uch of them as <lb/>became a duty by the compensation it procured: <lb/> and when
							that year was upon its close, Mary Ethell and <lb/>I were promised in marriage.</p>
						            <epage/>
						            <page n="[29/6]" image="a."/>
						            <p n="7">Her station in life, though not lofty, was one of more ease <lb/>than my own, and I had the
							satisfaction of knowing that it was <lb/> the earnestness of her attachment to me had deterred <lb/>her
							parents from placing any obstacle in the way of our union. <del>At the same time</del> All <lb/>the more
							<del>rigidly</del> on this account I now long to <lb/>
							              <del>the task now devolve upon me of</del> obtain<del>ing</del> at once such a position <del>which</del>
							              <lb/>as should raise me from <del>ever having to</del> reproach<add>ing</add>
							              <del>myself</del> with <del>the</del> any sacrifice made <lb/>by her for my sake. It was in this
							determination that I now set to work with all the energy of <lb/>which I was capable, upon a picture of
							some size, involving various <lb/>aspects of study. The subject was a modern one, and indeed it has
							<lb/>often seemed to me that all work, to be truly worthy, should be wrought <lb/>out of the age itself,
							as well as out of the soul of its producer, which <lb/>must needs be a soul of the age. At this picture I
							laboured unceasingly <lb/>my days and my nights. And Mary sat to me for <lb/>the principal female figure.
							The exhibition to which I sent it opened <lb/>a few weeks after the completion of my twenty-second year.</p>
