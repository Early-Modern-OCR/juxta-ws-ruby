<head>THE WHALE.<lb/>
CHAPTER I.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">loomings</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Call</hi> me Ishmael. Some years ago&#x2014;never mind<lb/>
how long precisely&#x2014;having little or no money in<lb/>
my purse, and nothing particular to interest me<lb/>
on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and<lb/>
see the watery part of the world. It is a way I<lb/>
have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the<lb/>
circulation. Whenever I find myself growing<lb/>
grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,<lb/>
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find<lb/>
myself involuntarily pausing before coffin ware-<lb/>
houses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral<lb/>
I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get<lb/>
such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong<lb/>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately<lb/>
stepping into the street, and methodically knoc-<lb/>
king people&#x0027;s hats off&#x2014;then, I account it high time<lb/>
to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substi-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n19" n="2"/>
tute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical<lb/>
flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I<lb/>
quietly take to the ship. There is nothing sur-<lb/>
prising in this. If they but knew it, almost all<lb/>
men in their degree, some time or other, cherish<lb/>
very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean<lb/>
with me.</p>
<p>There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes,<lb/>
belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral<lb/>
reefs&#x2014;commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right<lb/>
and left the streets take you waterward. Its ex-<lb/>
treme down-town is the Battery, where that noble<lb/>
mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes,<lb/>
which a few hours previous were out of sight of<lb/>
land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.</p>
<p>Circumambulate the city on a dreamy Sabbath<lb/>
afternoon; go from Corlears Hook to Coenties<lb/>
Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward.<lb/>
What do you see? Posted like silent sentinels all<lb/>
around the town, stand thousands upon thousands<lb/>
of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries; some lean-<lb/>
ing against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-<lb/>
heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships<lb/>
from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if<lb/>
striving to get a still better seaward peep. But<lb/>
these are all landsmen; of week-days pent up in<lb/>
lath and plaster &#x2014; tied to counters, nailed to<lb/>
benches, clinched to desks. How then is this?<lb/>
Are the green fields gone? What do they here?</p>
<pb xml:id="n20" n="3"/>
<p>But look! here come more crowds, pacing<lb/>
straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a<lb/>
dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but<lb/>
the extremest limit of the land: loitering under<lb/>
the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.<lb/>
No. They must get just as nigh the water as they<lb/>
possibly can without falling in. And there they<lb/>
stand&#x2014;miles of them&#x2014;leagues. Inlanders all,<lb/>
they come from lanes and alleys, streets and<lb/>
avenues&#x2014;north, east, south, and west. Yet here<lb/>
they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue<lb/>
in the needles of the compasses of all those ships<lb/>
attract them thither?</p>
<p>Once more. Say, you are in the country; in<lb/>
some high land of lakes. Take almost any path<lb/>
you please, and ten to one it carries you down in<lb/>
a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the<lb/>
stream. There is magic in it. Let the most<lb/>
absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest<lb/>
reveries&#x2014;stand that man on his legs, set his feet<lb/>
a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if<lb/>
water there be in all that region. Should you<lb/>
ever be athirst in the great American desert, try<lb/>
this experiment, if your caravan happen to be sup-<lb/>
plied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every<lb/>
one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.</p>
<p>But here is an artist. He desires to paint you<lb/>
the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n21" n="4"/>
bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the<lb/>
Saco. What is the chief element he employs?<lb/>
There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk,<lb/>
as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and<lb/>
here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle;<lb/>
and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.<lb/>
Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way,<lb/>
reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed<lb/>
in their hill-side blue. But though the picture<lb/>
lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes<lb/>
down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd&#x0027;s<lb/>
head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd&#x0027;s eye<lb/>
were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go<lb/>
visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on<lb/>
scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-<lb/>
lilies&#x2014;what is the one charm wanting?&#x2014;Water&#x2014;<lb/>
there is not a drop of water there! Were Nia-<lb/>
gara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your<lb/>
thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet<lb/>
of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls<lb/>
of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat,<lb/>
which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a<lb/>
pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is<lb/>
almost every robust healthy boy with a robust<lb/>
healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy<lb/>
to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a<lb/>
passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical<lb/>
vibration, when first told that you and your ship<lb/>
were now out of sight of land? Why did the old<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n22" n="5"/>
Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks<lb/>
give it a separate deity, and make him the own<lb/>
brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without<lb/>
meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that<lb/>
story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp<lb/>
the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,<lb/>
plunged into it and was drowned. But that same<lb/>
image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans.<lb/>
It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life;<lb/>
and this is the key to it all.</p>
<p>Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going<lb/>
to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the<lb/>
eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,<lb/>
I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go<lb/>
to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger<lb/>
you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a<lb/>
rag unless you have something in it. Besides,<lb/>
passengers get sea-sick&#x2014;grow quarrelsome&#x2014;don&#x0027;t<lb/>
sleep of nights&#x2014;do not enjoy themselves much, as<lb/>
a general thing;&#x2014;no, I never go as a passenger;<lb/>
nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go<lb/>
to sea as a commodore, or a captain, or a cook.<lb/>
I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices<lb/>
to those who like them. For my part, I abomi-<lb/>
nate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and<lb/>
tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite<lb/>
as much as I can do to take care of myself, with-<lb/>
out taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners,<lb/>
and what not. And as for going as cook,&#x2014;though<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n23" n="6"/>
I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook<lb/>
being a sort of officer on ship-board&#x2014;yet, some-<lb/>
how, I never fancied broiling fowls;&#x2014;though once<lb/>
broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically<lb/>
salted and peppered, there is no one who will<lb/>
speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially,<lb/>
of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the<lb/>
idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon<lb/>
broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see<lb/>
the mummies of those creatures in their huge<lb/>
bake-houses, the pyramids.</p>
<p>No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor,<lb/>
right before the mast, plumb down into the fore-<lb/>
castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True,<lb/>
they rather order me about, and make me jump<lb/>
from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May<lb/>
meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is un-<lb/>
pleasant enough. It touches one&#x0027;s sense of honour,<lb/>
particularly if you come of an old-established<lb/>
family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Ran-<lb/>
dolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if<lb/>
just previous to putting your hand into the tar-<lb/>
pot, you have been lording it as a country school-<lb/>
master, making the tallest boys stand in awe of<lb/>
you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you<lb/>
&#x2014;from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a<lb/>
strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to ena-<lb/>
ble you to grin and bear it. But even this wears<lb/>
off in time.</p>
<pb xml:id="n24" n="7"/>
<p>What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain<lb/>
orders me to get a broom and sweep down the<lb/>
decks? What does that indignity amount to&#x2014;<lb/>
weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testa-<lb/>
ment? Who is not a slave? Tell me that. Well,<lb/>
then, however the old sea-captains may order me<lb/>
about&#x2014;however they may thump and punch me<lb/>
about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is<lb/>
all right; that everybody else is one way or other<lb/>
served in much the same way, either in a physical<lb/>
or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the<lb/>
universal thump is passed round, and all hands<lb/>
should rub each others&#x0027; shoulder-blades, and be<lb/>
content.</p>
<p>Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because<lb/>
they make a point of paying me for my trouble,<lb/>
whereas they never pay passengers a single penny<lb/>
that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers<lb/>
themselves must pay: and there is all the differ-<lb/>
ence in the world between paying and being paid.<lb/>
The urbane activity with which a man receives<lb/>
money is really marvellous, considering that we<lb/>
so earnestly believe money to be the root of all<lb/>
earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied<lb/>
man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we con-<lb/>
sign ourselves to perdition!</p>
<p>Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because<lb/>
of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the<lb/>
forecastle deck. For as in this world, head winds<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n25" n="8"/>
are far more prevalent than winds from astern<lb/>
(that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean<lb/>
maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on<lb/>
the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second<lb/>
hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks<lb/>
he breathes it first; but not so. In much the<lb/>
same way do the commonalty lead their leaders<lb/>
in many other things, at the same time that the<lb/>
leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that<lb/>
after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a mer-<lb/>
chant sailor, I should now take it into my head to<lb/>
go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police<lb/>
officer of the Fates, who has the constant sur-<lb/>
veillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and in-<lb/>
fluences me in some unaccountable way&#x2014;he can<lb/>
better answer than any one else. I take it that<lb/>
this part of the bill, of those three mysterious<lb/>
ladies, must have run something like this:</p>
<quote>
<p><hi rend="i">&#x201C;Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.</hi></p>
<p>&#x201C;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.</p>
<p>&#x201C;BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.&#x201D;</p>
</quote>
<p>Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that<lb/>
those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for<lb/>
this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others<lb/>
were set down for magnificent parts in high<lb/>
tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n26" n="9"/>
comedies, and jolly parts in farces&#x2014;though I<lb/>
cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that<lb/>
I recal all the circumstances, I think I can see a<lb/>
little into the springs and motives which, being<lb/>
cunningly presented to me under various disguises,<lb/>
induced me to set about performing the part I did,<lb/>
besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was<lb/>
a choice resulting from my own unbiassed free-will<lb/>
and discriminating judgment.</p>
<p>Chief among these motives was the overwhelm-<lb/>
ing idea of the great whale himself. Such a<lb/>
portentous and mysterious monster roused all my<lb/>
curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where<lb/>
he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable,<lb/>
nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the<lb/>
attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights<lb/>
and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With<lb/>
other men, perhaps, such things would not have<lb/>
been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented<lb/>
with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love<lb/>
to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous<lb/>
coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to<lb/>
perceive a horror, and could still be social with<lb/>
it&#x2014;would they let me&#x2014;since it is but well to be on<lb/>
friendly terms with all the inmates of the place<lb/>
one lodges in.</p>
<p>By reason of these things, then, the whaling<lb/>
voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the<lb/>
wonder-world swung open, and in the wild con-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n27" n="10"/>
ceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two<lb/>
there floated into my inmost soul, endless pro-<lb/>
cessions of the whale, and, midmost of them all,<lb/>
one grand hooded phantom, like a snow-hill in<lb/>
the air.</p>
</div1>

<head>CHAPTER II.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the carpet-bag</hi>.</head>
<p>I <hi rend="sc">stuffed</hi> a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag,<lb/>
tucked it under my arm, and started for Cape<lb/>
Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of<lb/>
old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.<lb/>
It was on a Saturday night in December. Much<lb/>
was I disappointed upon learning that the little<lb/>
packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that<lb/>
no way of reaching that place would offer, till the<lb/>
following Monday.</p>
<p>As most young candidates for the pains and<lb/>
penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bed-<lb/>
ford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as<lb/>
well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so<lb/>
doing; for my mind was made up to sail in no<lb/>
other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a<lb/>
fine, boisterous something about everything con-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n28" n="11"/>
nected with that famous old island, which ama-<lb/>
zingly pleased me. Besides, though New Bedford<lb/>
has of late been gradually monopolizing the<lb/>
business of whaling, and though in this matter<lb/>
poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet<lb/>
Nantucket was her great original&#x2014;the Tyre of<lb/>
this Carthage,&#x2014;the place where the first dead<lb/>
American whale was stranded. Where else but<lb/>
from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen,<lb/>
the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give<lb/>
chase to the Leviathan? And where but from<lb/>
Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little<lb/>
sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobble-<lb/>
stones&#x2014;so goes the story&#x2014;to throw at the whales,<lb/>
in order to discover when they were nigh enough<lb/>
to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit!</p>
<p>Now, having a night, a day, and still another<lb/>
night following, before me in New Bedford, ere I<lb/>
could embark for my destined port, it became a<lb/>
matter of concernment where I was to eat and<lb/>
sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking,<lb/>
nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold<lb/>
and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With<lb/>
anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and<lb/>
only brought up a few pieces of silver. &#x201C;So,<lb/>
wherever you go, Ishmael,&#x201D; said I to myself, as I<lb/>
stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering<lb/>
my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the<lb/>
north with the darkness towards the south,&#x2014;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n29" n="12"/>
&#x201C;wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to<lb/>
lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to<lb/>
inquire the price, and don&#x0027;t be too particular.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With halting steps I paced the streets, and<lb/>
passed the sign of &#x201C;The Crossed Harpoons,&#x201D;&#x2014;but<lb/>
it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further<lb/>
on, from the bright-red windows of the &#x201C;Sword-<lb/>
Fish Inn,&#x201D; there came such fervent rays, that it<lb/>
seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice<lb/>
from before the house; for everywhere else the<lb/>
congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard,<lb/>
asphaltic pavement,&#x2014;rather weary for me, when<lb/>
I struck my foot against the flinty projections,<lb/>
because from hard, remorseless service the soles<lb/>
of my boots were in a most miserable plight.<lb/>
&#x201C;Too expensive and jolly, again,&#x201D; thought I,<lb/>
pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in<lb/>
the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling<lb/>
glasses within. &#x201C;But go on, Ishmael,&#x201D; said I at<lb/>
last; &#x201C;don&#x0027;t you hear? get away from before the<lb/>
door; your patched boots are stopping the way.&#x201D;<lb/>
So on I went. I now by instinct followed the<lb/>
streets that took me waterward, for there, doubt-<lb/>
less, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.</p>
<p>Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness&#x2014;not<lb/>
houses&#x2014;on either hand, and here and there a<lb/>
candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb.<lb/>
At this hour of the night, of the last day of the<lb/>
week, that quarter of the town proved all but<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n30" n="13"/>
deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light<lb/>
proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of<lb/>
which stood invitingly open. It had a careless<lb/>
look, as if it were meant for the uses of the<lb/>
public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to<lb/>
stumble over an ash-box in the porch. &#x201C;Ha!&#x201D;<lb/>
thought I, &#x201C;ha,&#x201D; as the flying particles almost<lb/>
choked me, &#x201C;are these ashes from that destroyed<lb/>
city, Gomorrah? But&#x2014;&#x2018;The Crossed Harpoons,&#x2019;<lb/>
and &#x2018;The Sword-Fish?&#x2019;&#x2014;this, then, must needs<lb/>
be the sign of &#x2018;The Trap.&#x2019;&#x201D; However, I picked<lb/>
myself up, and hearing a loud voice within, pushed<lb/>
on, and opened a second, interior door.</p>
<p>It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in<lb/>
Tophet. A hundred black faces turned round in<lb/>
their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel<lb/>
of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was<lb/>
a negro church; and the preacher&#x0027;s text was<lb/>
about the blackness of darkness, and the weep-<lb/>
ing and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. &#x201C;Ha,<lb/>
Ishmael,&#x201D; muttered I, backing out, &#x201C;wretched<lb/>
entertainment at the sign of &#x2018;The Trap.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of out-<lb/>
hanging light not far from the docks, and heard<lb/>
a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up,<lb/>
saw a swinging sign over the door with a white<lb/>
painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight<lb/>
jet of misty spray, and these words underneath&#x2014;&#x201C;-<lb/>
The Spouter-Inn:&#x2014;Peter Coffin.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n31" n="14"/>
<p>&#x201C;Coffin?&#x2014;Spouter?&#x2014;Rather ominous in that<lb/>
particular connexion,&#x201D; thought I. &#x201C;But it is a<lb/>
common name in Nantucket, they say, and I sup-<lb/>
pose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.&#x201D;<lb/>
As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the<lb/>
time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated<lb/>
little wooden house itself looked as if it might<lb/>
have been carted here from the ruins of some<lb/>
burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a<lb/>
poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought<lb/>
that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings,<lb/>
and the best of pea coffee.</p>
<p>It was a queer sort of place&#x2014;a gable-ended old<lb/>
house, one side palsied, as it were, and leaning<lb/>
over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,<lb/>
where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up<lb/>
a worse howling than ever it did about St. Paul&#x0027;s<lb/>
tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty<lb/>
pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet<lb/>
on the hob quietly toasting for bed. &#x201C;In judging<lb/>
of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,&#x201D;<lb/>
says an old writer&#x2014;of whose works I possess the<lb/>
only copy extant&#x2014;&#x201C;it maketh a marvellous dif-<lb/>
ference, whether thou lookest out at it from a<lb/>
glass window, where the frost is all on the outside,<lb/>
or whether thou observest it from that sashless<lb/>
window, where the frost is on both sides, and of<lb/>
which the wight Death is the only glazier.&#x201D; True<lb/>
enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n32" n="15"/>
mind&#x2014;old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes,<lb/>
these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is<lb/>
the house. What a pity they didn&#x0027;t stop up the<lb/>
chinks and the crannies, though, and thrust in a<lb/>
little lint here and there. But it&#x0027;s too late to<lb/>
make any improvements now. What a fine frosty<lb/>
night! how Orion glitters; what northern lights!<lb/>
Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of<lb/>
everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege<lb/>
of making my own summer with my own coals.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d3" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER III.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the spouter-inn</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Entering</hi> that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found<lb/>
yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry, with old-<lb/>
fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks<lb/>
of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a<lb/>
very large oil-painting, so thoroughly besmoked<lb/>
and every way defaced, that in the unequal cross-<lb/>
lights by which you viewed it, it was only by dili-<lb/>
gent study and a series of systematic visits to it,<lb/>
and careful inquiry of the neighbours, that you<lb/>
could any way arrive at an understanding of its<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n33" n="16"/>
purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades<lb/>
and shadows, that at first you almost thought<lb/>
some ambitious young artist, in the time of the<lb/>
New England hags, had endeavoured to delineate<lb/>
chaos bewitched. But by dint of much and ear-<lb/>
nest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings,<lb/>
and especially by throwing open the little window<lb/>
towards the back of the entry, you at last come to<lb/>
the conclusion that such an idea, however wild,<lb/>
might not be altogether unwarranted.</p>
<p>But what most puzzled and confounded you was<lb/>
a long, limber, portentous, black mass of some-<lb/>
thing hovering in the centre of the picture over<lb/>
three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a<lb/>
nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture<lb/>
truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.<lb/>
Yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained,<lb/>
unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze<lb/>
you to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with<lb/>
yourself to find out what that marvellous painting<lb/>
meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, de-<lb/>
ceptive idea would dart you through.&#x2014;It&#x0027;s the<lb/>
Black Sea in a midnight gale&#x2014;it&#x0027;s the unnatural<lb/>
combat of the four primal elements&#x2014;it&#x0027;s a blasted<lb/>
heath&#x2014;it&#x0027;s a Hyperborean winter scene&#x2014;it&#x0027;s the<lb/>
breaking-up of the ice-bound stream of Time.<lb/>
But at last all these fancies yielded to that one<lb/>
portentous something in the picture&#x0027;s midst. <hi rend="i">That</hi><lb/>
once found out, and all the rest were plain. But<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n34" n="17"/>
stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a<lb/>
gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?</p>
<p>In fact, the artist&#x0027;s design seemed this&#x2014;a, final<lb/>
theory of my own, partly based upon the aggre-<lb/>
gated opinions of many aged persons with whom<lb/>
I conversed upon the subject. The picture repre-<lb/>
sents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane; the<lb/>
half-foundered ship weltering there with its three<lb/>
dismantled masts alone visible; and an exaspe-<lb/>
rated whale, purposing to spring clean over the<lb/>
craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself<lb/>
upon the three mast-heads.</p>
<p>The opposite wall of this entry was hung all<lb/>
over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs<lb/>
and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering<lb/>
teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted<lb/>
with knots of human hair; and one was sickle-<lb/>
shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round, like<lb/>
the segment made in the new-mown grass by a<lb/>
long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed,<lb/>
and wondered what monstrous cannibal and sa-<lb/>
vage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with<lb/>
such a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed<lb/>
with these were rusty old whaling lances and<lb/>
harpoons, all broken and deformed. Some were<lb/>
storied weapons. With this once long lance, now<lb/>
wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain<lb/>
kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset.<lb/>
And that harpoon&#x2014;so like a corkscrew now&#x2014;was<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n35" n="18"/>
flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale,<lb/>
years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco.<lb/>
The original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a<lb/>
restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,<lb/>
travelled full forty feet, and at last was found<lb/>
imbedded in the hump.</p>
<p>Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon<lb/>
low-arched way&#x2014;cut through what in old times<lb/>
must have been a great central chimney with fire-<lb/>
places all round&#x2014;you enter the public room. A<lb/>
still duskier place is this, with such low ponde-<lb/>
rous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks<lb/>
beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod<lb/>
some old craft&#x0027;s cockpits, especially on such a<lb/>
howling night, when this corner-anchored old ark<lb/>
rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long,<lb/>
low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass<lb/>
cases, filled with dusty rarities gathered from this<lb/>
wide world&#x0027;s remotest nooks. Projecting from the<lb/>
further angle of the room stands a dark-looking<lb/>
den&#x2014;the bar&#x2014;a rude attempt at a right whale&#x0027;s<lb/>
head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast<lb/>
arched bone of the whale&#x0027;s jaw, so wide, a coach<lb/>
might almost drive beneath it. Within are shabby<lb/>
shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles,<lb/>
flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,<lb/>
bustles a little withered old man, who, for their<lb/>
money, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and<lb/>
death.</p>
<pb xml:id="n36" n="19"/>
<p>Abominable are the tumblers into which he<lb/>
pours his poison. Though true cylinders without<lb/>
&#x2014;within, the villanous green goggling glasses<lb/>
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.<lb/>
Parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass,<lb/>
surround these footpads&#x0027; goblets. Fill to <hi rend="i">this</hi><lb/>
mark, and your charge is but a penny; to <hi rend="i">this</hi> a<lb/>
penny more; and so on to the full glass&#x2014;the Cape<lb/>
Horn measure, which you may gulp down for a<lb/>
shilling.</p>
<p>Upon entering the place, I found a number of<lb/>
young seamen gathered about a table, examining<lb/>
by a dim light divers specimens of <hi rend="i">skrimshander.</hi><lb/>
I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to<lb/>
be accommodated with a room, received for answer<lb/>
that his house was full&#x2014;not a bed unoccupied.<lb/>
&#x201C;But avast,&#x201D; he added, tapping his forehead, &#x201C;you<lb/>
haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer&#x0027;s<lb/>
blanket, have ye? I s&#x0027;pose you are goin&#x0027;<lb/>
a whalin&#x0027;, so you&#x0027;d better get used to that sort of<lb/>
thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a<lb/>
bed; that if I should ever do so, it would depend<lb/>
upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he<lb/>
(the landlord) really had no other place for me, and<lb/>
the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable,<lb/>
why, rather than wander further about a strange<lb/>
town on so bitter a night, I would put up with the<lb/>
half of any decent man&#x0027;s blanket.</p>
<pb xml:id="n37" n="20"/>
<p>&#x201C;I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?<lb/>
&#x2014;you want supper? Supper&#x0027;ll be ready directly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all<lb/>
over like a bench on the Battery. At one end a<lb/>
ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his<lb/>
jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working<lb/>
away at the space between his legs. He was<lb/>
trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but she<lb/>
didn&#x0027;t make much headway, I thought.</p>
<p>At last some four or five of us were summoned to<lb/>
our meal in an adjoining room. It was cold as Ice-<lb/>
land&#x2014;no fire at all&#x2014;the landlord said he couldn&#x0027;t<lb/>
afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,<lb/>
each in a winding sheet. We were fain to button<lb/>
up out monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups<lb/>
of scalding tea with our half-frozen fingers. But<lb/>
the fare was of the most substantial kind&#x2014;not<lb/>
only meat and potatoes, but dumplings. Good<lb/>
heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow<lb/>
in a green box coat, addressed himself to these<lb/>
dumplings in a most direful manner.</p>
<p>&#x201C;My boy,&#x201D; said the landlord, &#x201C;you&#x0027;ll have the<lb/>
nightmare to a dead sartainty.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord,&#x201D; I whispered, &#x201C;that ain&#x0027;t the har-<lb/>
pooneer, is it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh, no,&#x201D; said he, looking a sort of diabolically<lb/>
funny, &#x201C;the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don&#x0027;t&#x2014;he<lb/>
eats nothing but steaks, and likes &#x0027;em rare.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n38" n="21"/>
<p>&#x201C;The devil he does,&#x201D; says I. &#x201C;where is that<lb/>
harpooneer? Is he here?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;ll be here afore long.&#x201D; was the answer.</p>
<p>I could not help it, but I began to feel suspi-<lb/>
cious of this &#x201C;dark complexioned&#x201D; harpooneer.<lb/>
any rate, I made up my mind that if it so<lb/>
turned out that we should sleep together, he must<lb/>
undress and get into bed before I did.</p>
<p>Supper over, the company went back to the<lb/>
bar-room, when, knowing not what else to do<lb/>
with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the<lb/>
evening as a looker-on.</p>
<p>Presently a rioting noise was heard without.<lb/>
Starting up, the landlord cried, &#x201C;That&#x0027;s the<lb/>
Grampus&#x0027;s crew. I seed her reported in the offing<lb/>
this morning; a three years&#x0027; voyage, and a full<lb/>
ship. Hurrah, boys; now we&#x0027;ll have the latest<lb/>
news from the Feegees.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry;<lb/>
the door was flung open, and in rolled a wild set<lb/>
of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy<lb/>
watch coats, and with their heads muffled in<lb/>
woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged, and<lb/>
their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an<lb/>
eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just<lb/>
landed from their boat, and this was the first<lb/>
house they entered. No wonder, then, that they<lb/>
made a straight wake for the whale&#x0027;s mouth&#x2014;the<lb/>
bar&#x2014;when the wrinkled little old fellow there<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n39" n="22"/>
officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all<lb/>
round. One complained of a bad cold in his<lb/>
head, upon which the old fellow mixed him a<lb/>
pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he<lb/>
swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and<lb/>
catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long<lb/>
standing, whether caught off the coast of La-<lb/>
brador, or on the weather side of an ice-island.</p>
<p>The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it<lb/>
generally does even with the arrantest topers<lb/>
newly landed from sea, and they began capering<lb/>
about most obstreperously.</p>
<p>I observed, however, that one of them held<lb/>
somewhat aloof, and though he seemed desirous<lb/>
not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his<lb/>
own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained<lb/>
from making as much noise as the rest. This man<lb/>
interested me at once; and since the sea-gods had<lb/>
ordained that he should soon become my shipmate<lb/>
(though but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this<lb/>
narrative is concerned), I will here venture upon<lb/>
a little description of him.</p>
<p>He stood full six feet in height, with noble<lb/>
shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have<lb/>
seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was<lb/>
deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth<lb/>
dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep<lb/>
shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences<lb/>
that did not seem to give him much joy. His<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n40" n="23"/>
voice at once announced that he was a Southerner;<lb/>
and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one<lb/>
of those tall mountaineers from the Alleganian<lb/>
Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his com-<lb/>
panions had mounted to its height, this man<lb/>
slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of<lb/>
him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a<lb/>
few minutes, however, he was missed by his ship-<lb/>
mates, and being, it seems, for some reason a<lb/>
huge favourite with them, they raised a cry of<lb/>
&#x201C;Bulkington! Bulkington! where&#x0027;s Bulkington!&#x201D;<lb/>
and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.</p>
<p>It was now about nine o&#x0027;clock, and the room<lb/>
seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these<lb/>
orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a<lb/>
little plan that had occurred to me just previous<lb/>
to the entrance of the seamen.</p>
<p>No man prefers to sleep two in a bed; in fact,<lb/>
you would a good deal rather not sleep with your<lb/>
own brother. I don&#x0027;t know how it is, but people<lb/>
like to be private when they are sleeping. And<lb/>
when it comes to sleeping with an unknown<lb/>
stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and<lb/>
that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections<lb/>
indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly<lb/>
reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed,<lb/>
more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep<lb/>
two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.<lb/>
To be sure they all sleep together in one apart-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n41" n="24"/>
ment, but you have your own hammock, and cover<lb/>
yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your<lb/>
own skin.</p>
<p>The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the<lb/>
more I abominated the thought of sleeping with<lb/>
him. It was getting late, and any decent har-<lb/>
pooneer ought to be home and going bedwards.<lb/>
Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at<lb/>
midnight&#x2014;how could I tell from what vile hole he<lb/>
had been coming?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord! I&#x0027;ve changed my mind about that<lb/>
harpooneer.&#x2014;I shan&#x0027;t sleep with him. I&#x0027;ll try the<lb/>
bench here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Just as you please; I&#x0027;m sorry I can&#x0027;t spare<lb/>
ye a tablecloth for a mattrass, and it&#x0027;s a plaguy<lb/>
rough board here&#x201D;&#x2014;feeling the knots and notches.<lb/>
&#x201C;But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I&#x0027;ve got a car-<lb/>
penter&#x0027;s plane there in the bar&#x2014;wait, I say, and<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll make ye snug enough.&#x201D; So saying, he pro-<lb/>
cured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief<lb/>
first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing<lb/>
away at my bed, the while grinning like an ape.<lb/>
The shavings flew right and left; till at last the<lb/>
plane-iron came bump against an indestructible<lb/>
knot. The landlord was near spraining his wrist,<lb/>
and I told him for heaven&#x0027;s sake to quit&#x2014;the bed<lb/>
was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know<lb/>
how all the planing in the world could make eider<lb/>
down of a pine plank. So gathering up the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n42" n="25"/>
shavings with another grin, and throwing them<lb/>
into the great stove in the middle of the room,<lb/>
he went about his business, and left me in a<lb/>
brown study.</p>
<p>I now took the measure of the bench, and found<lb/>
that it was a foot too short; but that could be<lb/>
mended with a chair. But it was a foot too nar-<lb/>
row, and the other bench in the room was about<lb/>
four inches higher than the planed one&#x2014;so there<lb/>
was no yoking them. I then placed the first bench<lb/>
lengthwise along the only clear space against the<lb/>
wall, leaving a little interval between, for my back<lb/>
to settle down in. But I soon found that there<lb/>
came such a draught of cold air over me from<lb/>
under the sill of the window, that this plan would<lb/>
never do at all, especially as another current from<lb/>
the rickety door met the one from the window,<lb/>
and both together formed a series of small whirl-<lb/>
winds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where<lb/>
I had thought to spend the night.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The devil fetch that harpooneer,&#x201D; thought I;<lb/>
&#x201C;but stop, couldn&#x0027;t I steal a march on him&#x2014;bolt<lb/>
his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be<lb/>
wakened by the most violent knockings?&#x201D; It<lb/>
seemed no bad idea; but upon second thoughts<lb/>
I dismissed it. For who could tell but that the<lb/>
next morning, so soon as I popped out of the<lb/>
room, the harpooneer might be standing in the<lb/>
entry, all ready to knock me down.</p>
<pb xml:id="n43" n="26"/>
<p>Still, looking round me again, and seeing no<lb/>
possible chance of spending a sufferable night<lb/>
unless in some other person&#x0027;s bed, I began to<lb/>
think that after all I might be cherishing unwar-<lb/>
rantable prejudices against this unknown har-<lb/>
pooneer. Thinks I, &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll wait awhile; he must be<lb/>
dropping in before long. I&#x0027;ll have a good look at<lb/>
him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good<lb/>
bedfellows after all&#x2014;there&#x0027;s no telling.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But though the other boarders kept coming in<lb/>
by ones, twos, and threes, and going to bed, yet<lb/>
no sign of my harpooneer.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord!&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;what sort of a chap is<lb/>
he&#x2014;does he always keep such late hours?&#x201D; It<lb/>
was now hard upon twelve o&#x0027;clock.</p>
<p>The landlord chuckled again with his lean<lb/>
chuckle, and seemed to be mightily tickled at<lb/>
something beyond my comprehension. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; he<lb/>
answered, &#x201C;generally he&#x0027;s an airley bird&#x2014;airley to<lb/>
bed and airley to rise&#x2014;yes, he&#x0027;s the bird what<lb/>
catches the worm.&#x2014;But to-night he went out a ped-<lb/>
dling, you see, and I don&#x0027;t see what on airth keeps<lb/>
him so late, unless, may be, he can&#x0027;t sell his head.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Can&#x0027;t sell his head?&#x2014;What sort of a bambooz-<lb/>
ingly story is this you are telling me?&#x201D; getting<lb/>
into a towering rage. &#x201C;Do you pretend to say,<lb/>
landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged<lb/>
this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday<lb/>
morning, in peddling his head around this town?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n44" n="27"/>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x0027;s precisely it,&#x201D; said the landlord, &#x201C;and I<lb/>
told him he couldn&#x0027;t sell it here&#x2014;the market&#x0027;s<lb/>
overstocked.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;With what?&#x201D; shouted I.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With heads, to be sure; ain&#x0027;t there too many<lb/>
heads in the world?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I tell you what it is, landlord,&#x201D; said I, quite<lb/>
calmly, &#x201C;you&#x0027;d better stop spinning that yarn to<lb/>
me&#x2014;I&#x0027;m not green.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;May be not,&#x201D; taking out a stick and whittling<lb/>
a toothpick, &#x201C;but I rayther guess you&#x0027;ll be done<lb/>
<hi rend="i">brown</hi> if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin&#x0027;<lb/>
his head.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x0027;ll break it for him,&#x201D; said I, now flying into<lb/>
a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of<lb/>
the landlord&#x0027;s.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x0027;s broke a&#x0027;ready,&#x201D; said he.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Broke,&#x201D; said I&#x2014;&#x201D;<hi rend="i">broke</hi>, do you mean?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sartain, and that&#x0027;s the very reason he can&#x0027;t<lb/>
sell it, I guess.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord,&#x201D; said I, going up to him as cool as<lb/>
Mount Hecla in a snow storm,&#x2014;&#x201C;landlord, stop<lb/>
whittling.You and I must understand one an-<lb/>
other, and that too without delay. I come to your<lb/>
house and want a bed; you tell me you can only<lb/>
give me half a one&#x2014;that the other half belongs to<lb/>
a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer,<lb/>
whom I have not yet seen, you persist in telling<lb/>
me the most mystifying and exasperating stories,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n45" n="28"/>
tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling<lb/>
towards the man whom you design for my bedfel-<lb/>
low&#x2014;a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an<lb/>
intimate and confidential one in the highest degree.<lb/>
I now demand of you to speak out and tell me<lb/>
who and what this harpooneer is, and whether I<lb/>
shall be in all respects safe to spend the night<lb/>
with him. And in the first place, you will be so<lb/>
good as to unsay that story about selling his head,<lb/>
which if true I take to be good evidence that this<lb/>
harpooneer is stark mad, and I&#x0027;ve no idea of sleep-<lb/>
ing with a madman; and you, sir&#x2014;<hi rend="i">you</hi> I mean,<lb/>
landlord,&#x2014;<hi rend="i">you</hi>, sir, by trying to induce me to do<lb/>
so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable<lb/>
to a criminal prosecution.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wall,&#x201D; said the landlord, fetching a long breath,<lb/>
&#x201C;that&#x0027;s a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a<lb/>
little now and then. But be easy, be easy: this<lb/>
here harpooneer I have been tellin&#x0027; you of has just<lb/>
arrived from the south seas, where he bought up<lb/>
a lot of &#x0027;balmed New Zealand heads (great curios,<lb/>
you know), and he&#x0027;s sold all on &#x0027;em but one, and<lb/>
that one he&#x0027;s trying to sell to-night, cause to-<lb/>
morrow&#x0027;s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin&#x0027;<lb/>
human heads about the streets when folks is goin&#x0027;<lb/>
to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I<lb/>
stopped him just as he was goin&#x0027; out of the door<lb/>
with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth<lb/>
like a string of inions.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n46" n="29"/>
<p>This account cleared up the otherwise unac-<lb/>
countable mystery, and showed that the landlord,<lb/>
after all, had had no idea of fooling me. But at<lb/>
the same time what could I think of a harpooneer<lb/>
who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the<lb/>
holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business<lb/>
as selling the heads of dead idolaters?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is<lb/>
a dangerous man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He pays reg&#x0027;lar,&#x201D; was the rejoinder. &#x201C;But<lb/>
come, it&#x0027;s getting dreadful late, you had better be<lb/>
turning flukes&#x2014;it&#x0027;s a nice bed: Sall and me slept<lb/>
in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There&#x0027;s<lb/>
plenty room for two to kick about in that bed;<lb/>
it&#x0027;s an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we<lb/>
give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little<lb/>
Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming<lb/>
and sprawling about one night, and somehow,<lb/>
Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near<lb/>
breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn&#x0027;t<lb/>
do. Come along here, I&#x0027;ll give ye a glim in a<lb/>
jiffy;&#x201D; and so saying, he lighted a candle and<lb/>
held it towards me, offering to lead the way. But<lb/>
I stood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the<lb/>
corner, he exclaimed, &#x201C;I vum its Sunday&#x2014;you<lb/>
won&#x0027;t see that harpooneer to-night; he&#x0027;s come to<lb/>
anchor somewhere&#x2014;come along then; <hi rend="i">do</hi> come; <hi rend="i">won&#x0027;t</hi> ye come?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I considered the matter a moment, and then<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n47" n="30"/>
up-stairs we went, and I was ushered into a small<lb/>
room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,<lb/>
with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed<lb/>
for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There,&#x201D; said the landlord, placing the candle<lb/>
on a crazy old sea-chest, that did double duty as<lb/>
a wash-stand and centre table; &#x201C;there, make<lb/>
yourself comfortable now, and good-night to ye.&#x201D;<lb/>
I turned round from eyeing the bed, but he had<lb/>
disappeared.</p>
<p>Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over<lb/>
the bed. Though none of the most elegant, it<lb/>
yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then<lb/>
glanced round the room; and besides the bed-<lb/>
stead and centre table, could see no other furni-<lb/>
ture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the<lb/>
four walls, and a papered fireboard representing<lb/>
a man striking a whale. Of things not properly<lb/>
belonging to the room, there was a hammock<lb/>
lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one cor-<lb/>
ner; also a large seaman&#x0027;s bag, containing the<lb/>
harpooneer&#x0027;s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land<lb/>
trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish<lb/>
bone fish-hooks on the shelf over the fire-place,<lb/>
and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the<lb/>
bed.</p>
<p>But what is this on the chest? I took it up,<lb/>
and held it close to the light, and felt it, and<lb/>
smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n48" n="31"/>
some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can<lb/>
compare it to nothing but a large door-mat, orna-<lb/>
mented at the edges with little tinkling tags, some-<lb/>
thing like the stained porcupine quills round an<lb/>
Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the<lb/>
middle of this mat, the same as in South American<lb/>
ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober<lb/>
harpooneer would get into a door-mat, and parade<lb/>
the streets of any Christian town in that sort of<lb/>
guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me<lb/>
down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy<lb/>
and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though<lb/>
this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it<lb/>
on a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass<lb/>
stuck against the wall, and tore myself out of it<lb/>
in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the<lb/>
neck.</p>
<p>I sat down on the side of the bed, and com-<lb/>
menced thinking about this head-peddling har-<lb/>
pooneer, and his door-mat. After thinking some<lb/>
time on the bed-side, I got up and took off my<lb/>
monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle of<lb/>
the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and<lb/>
thought a little more in my shirt sleeves. But<lb/>
beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as<lb/>
I was, and remembering what the landlord said<lb/>
about the harpooneer&#x0027;s not coming home at all<lb/>
that night, it being so very late, I made no more<lb/>
ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n49" n="32"/>
and then blowing out the light, tumbled into bed,<lb/>
and commended myself to the care of Heaven.</p>
<p>Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-<lb/>
cobs or broken crockery, there is no telling; but<lb/>
I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep<lb/>
for a long time. At last I slid off into a light<lb/>
doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing<lb/>
towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy<lb/>
footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light<lb/>
come into the room from under the door.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lord save me,&#x201D; thinks I, &#x201C;that must be the<lb/>
harpooneer, the infernal head-pedlar.&#x201D; But I lay<lb/>
perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till<lb/>
spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and<lb/>
that identical New Zealand head in the other,<lb/>
the stranger entered the room, and without look-<lb/>
ing towards the bed, placed his candle a good way<lb/>
off from me on the floor in one corner, and then<lb/>
began working away at the knotted cords of the<lb/>
large bag I before spoke of as being in the room.<lb/>
I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept<lb/>
it averted for some time while employed in un-<lb/>
lacing the bag&#x0027;s mouth. This accomplished, how-<lb/>
ever, he turned round&#x2014;when, good heavens!<lb/>
what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark,<lb/>
purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over<lb/>
with large, blackish looking squares. Yes, it&#x0027;s<lb/>
just as I thought, he&#x0027;s a terrible bedfellow; he&#x0027;s<lb/>
been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n50" n="33"/>
is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment<lb/>
he chanced to turn his face so towards the light,<lb/>
that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-<lb/>
plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks.<lb/>
They were stains of some sort or other. At first<lb/>
I knew not what to make of this; but soon an<lb/>
inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered<lb/>
a story of a white man&#x2014;a whaleman too&#x2014;who,<lb/>
falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by<lb/>
them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the<lb/>
course of his distant voyages, must have met with<lb/>
a similar adventure. And what is it, thought<lb/>
I, after all! It&#x0027;s only his outside; a man can be<lb/>
honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to<lb/>
make of his unearthly complexion&#x2014;that part of<lb/>
it, I mean lying round about, and completely<lb/>
independent of the squares of tattooing. To<lb/>
be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat<lb/>
of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a<lb/>
hot sun&#x0027;s tanning a white man into a purplish-<lb/>
yellow one. However, I had never been in<lb/>
the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there pro-<lb/>
duced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.<lb/>
Now, while all these ideas were passing through<lb/>
me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed<lb/>
me at all. But, after some difficulty, having<lb/>
opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it,<lb/>
and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and<lb/>
a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n51" n="34"/>
these on the old chest in the middle of the room,<lb/>
he then took the New Zealand head&#x2014;a ghastly<lb/>
thing enough&#x2014;and crammed it down into the<lb/>
bag. He now took off his hat&#x2014;a new beaver<lb/>
hat&#x2014;when I came nigh singing out with fresh<lb/>
surprise. There was no hair on his head&#x2014;none<lb/>
to speak of at least&#x2014;nothing but a small scalp-<lb/>
knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald<lb/>
purplish head now looked for all the world like a<lb/>
mildewed skull. Had not the stranger stood<lb/>
between me and the door, I would have bolted<lb/>
out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.</p>
<p>Even as it was, I thought something of slipping<lb/>
out of the window, but it was the second floor<lb/>
back. I am no coward, but what to make of this<lb/>
head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my<lb/>
comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of fear,<lb/>
and being completely nonplussed and confounded<lb/>
about the stranger, I confess I was now as much<lb/>
afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who<lb/>
had thus broken into my room at the dead of<lb/>
night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I<lb/>
was not game enough just then to address him,<lb/>
and demand a satisfactory answer concerning<lb/>
what seemed inexplicable in him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he continued the business of un-<lb/>
dressing, and at last showed his chest and arms.<lb/>
As I live, these covered parts of him were<lb/>
checkered with the same squares as his face; his<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n52" n="35"/>
back, too, was all over the same dark squares:<lb/>
he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years&#x0027; War,<lb/>
and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster<lb/>
shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as<lb/>
if a parcel of dark-green frogs were running<lb/>
up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite<lb/>
plain that he must be some abominable savage or<lb/>
other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South<lb/>
Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I<lb/>
quaked to think of it. A pedlar of heads too&#x2014;<lb/>
perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might<lb/>
take a fancy to mine&#x2014;heavens! look at that<lb/>
tomahawk!</p>
<p>But there was no time for shuddering, for now<lb/>
the savage went about something that completely<lb/>
fascinated my attention, and convinced me that<lb/>
he must, indeed, be a heathen. Going to his<lb/>
heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnought, which<lb/>
he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in<lb/>
the pockets, and produced at length a curious<lb/>
little deformed image with a hunch on its back,<lb/>
and exactly the colour of a three days&#x0027; old Congo<lb/>
baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first<lb/>
I almost thought that this black manakin was<lb/>
a real baby preserved in some similar manner.<lb/>
But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that<lb/>
it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I<lb/>
concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden<lb/>
idol, which, indeed, it proved to be. For now the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n53" n="36"/>
savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and re-<lb/>
moving the papered fire-board, sets up this little<lb/>
hunchbacked image, like a tenpin, between the<lb/>
andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks<lb/>
inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-<lb/>
place made a very appropriate little shrine or<lb/>
chapel for his Congo idol.</p>
<p>I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half<lb/>
hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime,<lb/>
to see what was next to follow. First he takes<lb/>
about a double handful of shavings out of his<lb/>
grego pocket, and places them carefully before<lb/>
the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top,<lb/>
and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled<lb/>
the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently,<lb/>
after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still<lb/>
hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he<lb/>
seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last<lb/>
succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blow-<lb/>
ing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite<lb/>
offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil<lb/>
did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all<lb/>
&#x2014;he never moved his lips. All these strange<lb/>
antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural<lb/>
noises from the devotee, who seemed to be pray-<lb/>
ing in a sing-song, or else singing some pagan<lb/>
psalmody or other, during which his face twitched<lb/>
about in the most unnatural manner. At last<lb/>
extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n54" n="37"/>
unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego<lb/>
pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.</p>
<p>All these queer proceedings increased my uncom-<lb/>
fortableness, and seeing him now exhibiting strong<lb/>
symptoms of concluding his business operations,<lb/>
and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was<lb/>
high time, now or never, before the light was put<lb/>
out, to break the spell in which I had been so long<lb/>
bound.</p>
<p>But the interval I spent in deliberating what to<lb/>
say was a fatal one. Taking up his tomahawk<lb/>
from the table, he examined the head of it for an<lb/>
instant, and then holding it to the light with his<lb/>
mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of<lb/>
tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was<lb/>
extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk<lb/>
between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I<lb/>
sang out,&#x2014;I could not help it now; and giving<lb/>
a sudden grunt of astonishment, he began feel-<lb/>
ing me.</p>
<p>Stammering out something, I knew not what,<lb/>
I rolled away from him against the wall, and then<lb/>
conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be,<lb/>
to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the<lb/>
lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied<lb/>
me at once that he but ill comprehended my<lb/>
meaning.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who-e debel you?&#x201D; he at last said; &#x201C;you<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n55" n="38"/>
no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.&#x201D; And so saying<lb/>
the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me<lb/>
in the dark.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord, for God&#x0027;s sake! Peter Coffin!&#x201D;<lb/>
shouted I. &#x201C;Landlord! Watch! Coffin! An-<lb/>
gels! save me!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I<lb/>
kill-e!&#x201D; again growled the cannibal, while his<lb/>
horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the<lb/>
hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my<lb/>
linen would get on fire. But thank heaven, at<lb/>
that moment the landlord came into the room,<lb/>
light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up<lb/>
to him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Don&#x0027;t be afraid now,&#x201D; said he, grinning again.<lb/>
&#x201C;Queequeg here wouldn&#x0027;t harm a hair of your<lb/>
head.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stop your grinning,&#x201D; shouted I; &#x201C;and why<lb/>
didn&#x0027;t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer<lb/>
was a cannibal?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I thought ye know&#x0027;d it;&#x2014;didn&#x0027;t I tell ye, he was a peddlin&#x0027; heads around town?&#x2014;but turn<lb/>
flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look<lb/>
here&#x2014;you sabbee me, I sabbee you&#x2014;this man<lb/>
sleepe you&#x2014;you sabbee?&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Me sabbee plenty,&#x201D; grunted Queequeg, puf-<lb/>
fing away at his pipe and sitting up in bed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You gettee in,&#x201D; he added, motioning to me<lb/>
with his tomahawk, and throwing the clothes to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n56" n="39"/>
one side. He really did this in not only a civil<lb/>
but a really kind and charitable way. I stood<lb/>
looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings,<lb/>
he was on the whole a clean, comely-looking can-<lb/>
nibal. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s all this fuss I have been making<lb/>
about,&#x201D; thought I to myself; &#x201C;the man&#x0027;s a<lb/>
human being just as I am: he has just as much<lb/>
reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.<lb/>
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken<lb/>
Christian.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Landlord,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;tell him to stash his<lb/>
tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it;<lb/>
tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn<lb/>
in with him. But I don&#x0027;t fancy having a man<lb/>
smoking in bed with me. It&#x0027;s dangerous. Be-<lb/>
sides, I ain&#x0027;t insured.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This being told to Queequeg, he at once com-<lb/>
plied, and again politely motioned me to get into<lb/>
bed, rolling over to one side, as much as to say<lb/>
&#x2014;&#x201C;I won&#x0027;t touch a leg of ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good night, landlord,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;you may go<lb/>
&#x201D;</p>
<p>I turned in, and never slept better in my life.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the counterpane</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Upon</hi> waking next morning about daylight, I<lb/>
found Queequeg&#x0027;s arm thrown over me in the<lb/>
most loving and affectionate manner. You had<lb/>
almost thought I had been his wife. The coun-<lb/>
terpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-<lb/>
coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of<lb/>
his, tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan<lb/>
labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were<lb/>
of one precise shade&#x2014;owing, I suppose, to his<lb/>
keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and<lb/>
shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at<lb/>
various times&#x2014;this same arm of his, I say, looked<lb/>
for all the world like a strip of that same patch-<lb/>
work quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm<lb/>
did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from<lb/>
the quilt, they so blended their hues together;<lb/>
and it was only by the sense of weight and pres-<lb/>
sure that I could tell that Queequeg was hug-<lb/>
ging me.</p>
<p>My sensations were strange. Let me try to<lb/>
explain them. When I was a child, I well re-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n58" n="41"/>
member a somewhat similar circumstance that<lb/>
befel me; whether it was a reality or a dream,<lb/>
I never could entirely settle. The circumstance<lb/>
was this. I had been cutting up some caper or<lb/>
other&#x2014;I think it was trying to crawl up the<lb/>
chimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few<lb/>
days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow<lb/>
or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending<lb/>
me to bed supperless,&#x2014;my stepmother dragged me<lb/>
by the legs out of the chimney, and packed me off<lb/>
to bed, though it was only two o&#x0027;clock in the<lb/>
afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day in the<lb/>
year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But<lb/>
there was no help for it, so up-stairs I went to<lb/>
my little room in the third floor, undressed myself<lb/>
as slowly as possible, so as to kill time, and with<lb/>
a bitter sigh got between the sheets.</p>
<p>I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen<lb/>
entire hours must elapse before I could hope to<lb/>
get out of bed again. Sixteen hours in bed! the<lb/>
small of my back ached to think of it. And it<lb/>
was so light too; the sun shining in at the<lb/>
window, and a great rattling of coaches in the<lb/>
streets, and the sound of gay voices all over<lb/>
the house. I felt worse and worse&#x2014;at last I got<lb/>
up, dressed, and softly going in my stockinged<lb/>
feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly<lb/>
threw myself at her feet, beseeching her as a par-<lb/>
ticular favour to give me a good slippering for my<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n59" n="42"/>
misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning<lb/>
me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.<lb/>
But she was the best and most conscientious of<lb/>
stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room.<lb/>
For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling<lb/>
a great deal worse than I have ever done since,<lb/>
even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.<lb/>
At last I must have fallen into a troubled night-<lb/>
mare of a doze; and slowly waking from it&#x2014;half<lb/>
steeped in dreams&#x2014;I opened my eyes, and the<lb/>
before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer<lb/>
darkness. Instantly I felt a shock running<lb/>
through all my frame; nothing was to be seen,<lb/>
and nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural<lb/>
hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over<lb/>
the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,<lb/>
silent form or phantom, to which the hand be-<lb/>
longed, seemed closely seated by my bedside.<lb/>
For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,<lb/>
frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to<lb/>
drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that, if<lb/>
I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell<lb/>
would be broken. I knew not how this conscious-<lb/>
ness at last glided away from me; but waking in<lb/>
the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all,<lb/>
and for days, and weeks, and months afterwards,<lb/>
I lost myself in confounding attempts to explain<lb/>
the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often<lb/>
puzzle myself with it.</p>
<pb xml:id="n60" n="43"/>
<p>Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensa-<lb/>
tions at feeling the supernatural hand in mine<lb/>
were very similar, in their strangeness, to those<lb/>
which I experienced on waking up and see-<lb/>
ing Queequeg&#x0027;s pagan arm thrown round me.<lb/>
But at length all the past night&#x0027;s events soberly<lb/>
recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then<lb/>
I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For<lb/>
though I tried to move his arm&#x2014;unlock his clasp<lb/>
&#x2014;yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me<lb/>
tightly, as though nought but death should part<lb/>
us twain. I now strove to rouse him&#x2014;&#x201C;Quee-<lb/>
queg!&#x201D;&#x2014;but his only answer was a snore. I then<lb/>
rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a<lb/>
horse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.<lb/>
Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the<lb/>
tomahawk, sleeping by the savage&#x0027;s side, as if it<lb/>
were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle, truly,<lb/>
thought I; abed here in a strange house in the<lb/>
broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk!<lb/>
&#x201C;Queequeg!&#x2014;in the name of goodness, Quee-<lb/>
queg, wake!&#x201D; At length, by dint of much<lb/>
wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations<lb/>
upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow-<lb/>
male in that sort of style, I succeeded in extract-<lb/>
ing a grunt; and presently he drew back his arm,<lb/>
shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog<lb/>
just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as<lb/>
a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n61" n="44"/>
as if he did not altogether remember how I came<lb/>
to be there, though a dim consciousness of know-<lb/>
ing something about me seemed slowly dawning<lb/>
over him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him,<lb/>
having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon<lb/>
narrowly observing so curious a creature. When,<lb/>
at last, his mind seemed made up touching the<lb/>
character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it<lb/>
were, reconciled to the fact, he jumped out upon<lb/>
the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave<lb/>
me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would<lb/>
dress first, and then leave me to dress afterwards,<lb/>
leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks<lb/>
I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a<lb/>
very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these<lb/>
savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what<lb/>
you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite<lb/>
they are. I pay this particular compliment to<lb/>
Queequeg, because he treated me with so much<lb/>
civility and consideration, while I was guilty of<lb/>
great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and<lb/>
watching all his toilette motions; for the time<lb/>
my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.<lb/>
Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don&#x0027;t see<lb/>
every day&#x2014;he and his ways were well worth<lb/>
unusual regarding.</p>
<p>He commenced dressing at top by donning his<lb/>
beaver hat, a very tall one, by-the-by, and then&#x2014;<lb/>
still minus his trowsers&#x2014;he hunted up his boots.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n62" n="45"/>
What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot<lb/>
tell, but his next movement was to crush himself<lb/>
&#x2014;boots in hand, and hat on&#x2014;under the bed;<lb/>
when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings,<lb/>
I inferred he was hard at work booting himself;<lb/>
though by no law of propriety that I ever heard<lb/>
of, is any man required to be private when putting<lb/>
on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a<lb/>
creature in the transition state&#x2014;neither caterpillar<lb/>
nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized to<lb/>
show off his outlandishness in the strangest pos-<lb/>
sible manner. His education was not yet com-<lb/>
pleted. He was an undergraduate. If he had<lb/>
not been a small degree civilized, he very probably<lb/>
would not have troubled himself with boots at all;<lb/>
but then, if he had not been still a savage, he<lb/>
never would have dreamt of getting under the<lb/>
bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with<lb/>
his hat very much dented and crushed down over<lb/>
his eyes, and began creaking and limping about<lb/>
the room, as if, not being much accustomed to<lb/>
boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones&#x2014;<lb/>
probably not made to order either&#x2014;rather pinched<lb/>
and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter<lb/>
cold morning.</p>
<p>Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the<lb/>
window, and that the street being very narrow,<lb/>
the house opposite commanded a plain view into<lb/>
the room, and observing more and more the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n63" n="46"/>
indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving<lb/>
about with little else but his hat and boots on;<lb/>
I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his<lb/>
toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his<lb/>
pantaloons as soon as possible. He complied, and<lb/>
then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in<lb/>
the morning any Christian would have washed his<lb/>
face; but Queequeg, to my amazement, contented<lb/>
himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest,<lb/>
arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat,<lb/>
and taking up a piece of hard soap on the washs-<lb/>
tand centre-table, dipped it into water and com-<lb/>
menced lathering his face. I was watching to see<lb/>
where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he<lb/>
takes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out<lb/>
the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets<lb/>
it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit<lb/>
of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous<lb/>
scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.<lb/>
Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers&#x0027;s best<lb/>
cutlery with a vengeance. Afterwards I wondered<lb/>
the less at this operation, when I came to know<lb/>
of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made,<lb/>
and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges<lb/>
are always kept.</p>
<p>The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he<lb/>
proudly marched out of the room, wrapped up in<lb/>
his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his<lb/>
harpoon like a marshal&#x0027;s baton.</p>
</div1>

<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d5" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER V.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">breakfast</hi>.</head>
<p>I <hi rend="sc">quickly</hi> followed suit, and descending into the<lb/>
bar-room accosted the grinning landlord very<lb/>
pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,<lb/>
though he had been skylarking with me not a<lb/>
little in the matter of my bedfellow.</p>
<p>However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing,<lb/>
and rather too scarce a good thing, the more&#x0027;s<lb/>
the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper<lb/>
person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let<lb/>
him not be backward, but let him cheerfully allow<lb/>
himself to spend and be spent in that way. And<lb/>
the man that has anything bountifully laughable<lb/>
about him, be sure there is more in that man than<lb/>
you perhaps think for.</p>
<p>The bar-room was now full of the boarders<lb/>
who had been dropping in the night previous, and<lb/>
whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They<lb/>
were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second<lb/>
mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and<lb/>
sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers,<lb/>
and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n65" n="48"/>
with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all<lb/>
wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.</p>
<p>You could pretty plainly tell how long each one<lb/>
had been ashore. This young fellow&#x0027;s healthy<lb/>
cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would<lb/>
seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have<lb/>
been three days landed from his Indian voyage.<lb/>
That man nest him looks a few shades lighter;<lb/>
you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.<lb/>
In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic<lb/>
tawn, but slightly bleached withal; <hi rend="i">he</hi> doubtless<lb/>
has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could<lb/>
show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with<lb/>
various tints, seemed like the Andes&#x0027; western slope,<lb/>
to show forth in one array, contrasting climates,<lb/>
zone by zone.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Grub, ho!&#x201D; now cried the landlord, flinging<lb/>
open a door, and in we went to breakfast.</p>
<p>They say that men who have seen the world,<lb/>
thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite<lb/>
self-possessed in company. Not always, though:<lb/>
Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and<lb/>
Mungo Park, the Scotch one&#x2014;of all men, they<lb/>
possessed the least assurance in the parlour. But<lb/>
perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge<lb/>
drawn by dogs, as Ledyard did, or the taking a<lb/>
long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the<lb/>
negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor<lb/>
Mungo&#x0027;s performances&#x2014;this kind of travel, I say,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n66" n="49"/>
may not be the very best mode of attaining a<lb/>
high social polish. Still, for the most part, that<lb/>
sort of thing is to be had anywhere.</p>
<p>These reflections just here are occasioned by<lb/>
the circumstance, that after we were all seated<lb/>
at the table, and I was preparing to hear some<lb/>
good stories about whaling, to my no small sur-<lb/>
prise, nearly every man maintained a profound<lb/>
silence; and not only that, but they looked em-<lb/>
barrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many<lb/>
of whom without the slightest bashfulness had<lb/>
boarded great whales on the high seas&#x2014;entire<lb/>
strangers to them&#x2014;and duelled them dead with-<lb/>
out winking; and yet, here they sat at a social<lb/>
breakfast table&#x2014;all of the same calling, all of<lb/>
kindred tastes&#x2014;looking round as sheepishly at<lb/>
each other as though they had never been out of<lb/>
sight of some sheepfold among the Green Moun-<lb/>
tains. A curious sight, these bashful bears, these<lb/>
timid warrior whalemen!</p>
<p>But as for Queequeg&#x2014;why, Queequeg sat there<lb/>
among them&#x2014;at the head of the table, too, it so<lb/>
chanced&#x2014;as cool as an icicle. To be sure, I cannot<lb/>
say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer<lb/>
could not have cordially justified his bringing his<lb/>
harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it<lb/>
there without ceremony; reaching over the table<lb/>
with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads,<lb/>
and grappling the beefsteaks towards him. But<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n67" n="50"/>
<hi rend="i">that</hi> was certainly very coolly done by him, and<lb/>
every one knows that in most people&#x0027;s estimation,<lb/>
to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.</p>
<p>We will not speak of all Queequeg&#x0027;s peculiar-<lb/>
rities here; how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls,<lb/>
and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks,<lb/>
done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was<lb/>
over, he withdrew like the rest into the public<lb/>
room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting<lb/>
there quietly digesting and smoking with his inse-<lb/>
parable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d6" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER VI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the street</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">If</hi> I had been astonished at first catching a<lb/>
glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Quee-<lb/>
queg circulating among the polite society of a<lb/>
civilized town, that astonishment soon departed<lb/>
upon taking my first daylight stroll through the<lb/>
streets of New Bedford.</p>
<p>In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any consider-<lb/>
able seaport will frequently offer to view the queer-<lb/>
est looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n68" n="51"/>
in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean<lb/>
mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted<lb/>
ladies. Regent-street is not unknown to Lascars<lb/>
and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green,<lb/>
live Yankees have often scared the natives. But<lb/>
New Bedford beats all Water-street and Wap-<lb/>
ping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see<lb/>
only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual canni-<lb/>
bals stand chatting at street corners&#x2014;savages<lb/>
outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones<lb/>
unholy flesh. It makes a stranger stare.</p>
<p>But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatabooans,<lb/>
Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and Brighggians,<lb/>
and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-<lb/>
craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you<lb/>
will see other sights still more curious, certainly<lb/>
more comical. There weekly arrive in this town<lb/>
scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire<lb/>
men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.<lb/>
They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fel-<lb/>
lows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop<lb/>
the axe and snatch the whale-lance. Many are<lb/>
as green as the Green Mountains whence they<lb/>
come. In some things you would think them<lb/>
but a few hours old. Look there! that chap<lb/>
strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver<lb/>
hat and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-<lb/>
belt and sheath-knife. Here comes another with<lb/>
a sou&#x0027;-wester and a bombazine cloak.</p>
<pb xml:id="n69" n="52"/>
<p>No town-bred dandy will compare with a coun-<lb/>
try-bred one&#x2014;I mean a downright bumpkin dandy<lb/>
&#x2014;a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his<lb/>
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning<lb/>
his hands. Now, when a country dandy like this<lb/>
takes it into his head to make a distinguished<lb/>
reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you<lb/>
should see the comical things he does upon reach-<lb/>
ing the seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit,<lb/>
he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats, straps to<lb/>
his canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-seed! how<lb/>
bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling<lb/>
gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and<lb/>
all, down the throat of the tempest.</p>
<p>But think not that this famous town has only<lb/>
harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkins, to show<lb/>
her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is<lb/>
a queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen,<lb/>
that tract of land would this day perhaps have<lb/>
been in as howling a condition as the coast of<lb/>
Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country<lb/>
are enough to frighten one&#x2014;they look so bony.<lb/>
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to<lb/>
live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil,<lb/>
true enough; but not like Canaan; a land, also,<lb/>
of corn and wine. The streets do not run with<lb/>
milk: nor in the spring-time do they pave them<lb/>
with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere<lb/>
in all America will you find more patrician-like<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n70" n="53"/>
houses, parks and gardens more opulent, than in<lb/>
New Bedford. Whence came they how planted<lb/>
upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?</p>
<p>Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical har-<lb/>
poons round yonder lofty mansion, and your<lb/>
question will be answered. Yes; all these brave<lb/>
houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlan-<lb/>
tic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all,<lb/>
they were harpooned and dragged up hither from<lb/>
the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales<lb/>
for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their<lb/>
nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must<lb/>
go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding;<lb/>
for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every<lb/>
house, and every night recklessly burn their<lb/>
lengths in spermaceti candles.</p>
<p>In summer time the town is sweet to see; full<lb/>
of fine maples&#x2014;long avenues of green and gold.<lb/>
And in August, high in air, the beautiful and<lb/>
bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer<lb/>
the passer-by their tapering upright cones of con-<lb/>
gregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art: which<lb/>
in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced<lb/>
bright terraces of flowers upon these barren refuse<lb/>
rocks.</p>
<p>And the women of New Bedford&#x2014;they bloom<lb/>
like their own red roses. But roses only bloom in<lb/>
summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n71" n="54"/>
is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.<lb/>
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot,<lb/>
save in Salem; where they tell me the young girls<lb/>
breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell<lb/>
them miles off shore, as though they were drawing<lb/>
nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic<lb/>
sands.</p>

spot. I am sure that I did not.</p>
<p>Returning from my first morning stroll, I again<lb/>
sallied out upon this special errand. The sky had<lb/>
changed from clear sunny cold, to driving sleet and<lb/>
mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of<lb/>
the cloth called bearskin, I fought my way against<lb/>
the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small<lb/>

HIS WIDOW.</p>
</quote>
<p>Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat<lb/>
and jacket, I seated myself near the door, and<lb/>
turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg<lb/>
near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene,<lb/>
there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity<lb/>
in his countenance. This savage was the only<lb/>
person present who seemed to notice my entrance;<lb/>
because he was the only one who could not read,<lb/>
and, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscrip-<lb/>
tions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of<lb/>
the seamen whose names appeared there were now<lb/>
among the congregation, I knew not; but so many<lb/>
are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so<lb/>
plainly did several women present wear the coun-<lb/>
tenance, if not the trappings, of some unceasing<lb/>
grief, that I feel sure that here before me were as-<lb/>
sembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight<lb/>
of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the<lb/>
old wounds to bleed afresh.</p>
<pb xml:id="n74" n="57"/>
<p>Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the<lb/>
green grass; who standing among flowers can say<lb/>
&#x2014;here, <hi rend="i">here</hi> lies my beloved; ye know not the<lb/>
desolation that broods in bosoms like these.<lb/>
What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles<lb/>
which cover no ashes! What despair in those<lb/>
immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and<lb/>
unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to<lb/>
gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to the<lb/>
beings who have placelessly perished without a<lb/>
grave. As well might those tablets stand in the<lb/>
cave of Elephanta as here.</p>
<p>In what census of living creatures the dead of<lb/>
mankind are included; why it is that an universal<lb/>
proverb says of them, that they tell no tales,<lb/>
though containing more secrets than the Goodwin<lb/>
Sands; how it is that to his name, who yesterday<lb/>
departed for the other world, we prefix so signifi-<lb/>
cant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle<lb/>
him, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of<lb/>
this living earth; why the Life Insurance Compa-<lb/>
nies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in<lb/>
what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly,<lb/>
hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died<lb/>
sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we still<lb/>
refuse to be comforted for those who we neverthe-<lb/>
less maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss;<lb/>
why all the living so strive to hush all the dead;<lb/>
wherefore the rumour of a knocking in a tomb<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n75" n="58"/>
will terrify a whole city&#x2014;all these things are not<lb/>
without their meanings.</p>
<p>But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs,<lb/>
and even from these dead doubts she gathers her<lb/>
most vital hope.</p>
<p>It needs scarcely to be told with what feelings,<lb/>
on the eve of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those<lb/>
marble tablets, and by the murky light of that<lb/>
darkened, doleful day, read the fate of the whale-<lb/>
men who had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the<lb/>
same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew<lb/>
merry again. Delightful inducements to embark,<lb/>
fine chance for promotion, it seems&#x2014;aye, a stove-<lb/>
boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes,<lb/>
there is death in this business of whaling&#x2014;a<lb/>
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into<lb/>
Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have<lb/>
hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.<lb/>
Methinks, that what they call my shadow here on<lb/>
earth is my true substance. Methinks that in<lb/>
looking at things spiritual, we are too much like<lb/>
oysters observing the sun through the water, and<lb/>
thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.<lb/>
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better<lb/>
being. In fact take my body who will, take it<lb/>
I say, it is not myself. And, therefore, three<lb/>
cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat, and<lb/>
stove body when they will, for stave my soul, who<lb/>
can do this?</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the pulpit</hi>.</head>
<p>I <hi rend="sc">had</hi> not been seated very long ere a man of a<lb/>
certain venerable robustness entered; immediately<lb/>
as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting<lb/>
him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the<lb/>
congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old<lb/>
man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous<lb/>
Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among<lb/>
whom he was a very great favourite. He had<lb/>
been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but<lb/>
for many years past had dedicated his life to<lb/>
the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father<lb/>
Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old<lb/>
age; that sort of old age which seems merging into<lb/>
a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures<lb/>
of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a<lb/>
newly developing bloom&#x2014;the spring verdure peep-<lb/>
ing forth even beneath February&#x0027;s snow. No one<lb/>
having previously heard his history, could for the<lb/>
first time behold Father Mapple without the ut-<lb/>
most interest, because there were certain engrafted<lb/>
clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n77" n="60"/>
adventurous maritime life he had led. When he<lb/>
entered, I observed that he carried no umbrella,<lb/>
and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his<lb/>
tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his<lb/>
great pilot-cloth jacket seemed almost to drag<lb/>
him to the floor with the weight of the water<lb/>
it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and<lb/>
overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up<lb/>
in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,<lb/>
arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached<lb/>
the pulpit.</p>
<p>Like most old-fashioned pulpits, it was a very<lb/>
lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a<lb/>
height would, by its long angle with the floor,<lb/>
seriously contract the already small area of the<lb/>
chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon<lb/>
the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit<lb/>
without stairs, substituting a perpendicular side<lb/>
ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a<lb/>
boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had<lb/>
provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red<lb/>
worsted manropes for this ladder, which, being<lb/>
itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany<lb/>
colour, the whole contrivance, considering what<lb/>
manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in<lb/>
bad taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of<lb/>
the ladder, and with both hands grasping the<lb/>
ornamental knobs of the manropes, Father Mapple<lb/>
cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n78" n="61"/>
like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand,<lb/>
mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of<lb/>
his vessel.</p>
<p>The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as<lb/>
is usually the case with swinging ones, were of<lb/>
cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,<lb/>
so that at every step there was a joint. At my<lb/>
first glimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me<lb/>
that, however convenient for a ship, these joints<lb/>
in the present instance seemed unnecessary: for<lb/>
I was not prepared to see Father Mapple, after<lb/>
gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stoop-<lb/>
ing over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder<lb/>
step by step, till the whole was deposited within,<lb/>
leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.</p>
<p>I pondered some time without fully compre-<lb/>
hending the reason for this. Father Mapple en-<lb/>
joyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and<lb/>
sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting<lb/>
notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No,<lb/>
thought I, there must be some sober reason for<lb/>
this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize some-<lb/>
thing unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act<lb/>
of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual with-<lb/>
drawal for the time from all outward worldly ties<lb/>
and connexions? Yes; for replenished with the<lb/>
meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of<lb/>
God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing strong-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n79" n="62"/>
hold&#x2014;a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial<lb/>
well of water within the walls.</p>
<p>But the side ladder was not the only strange<lb/>
feature of the place, borrowed from the chaplain&#x0027;s<lb/>
former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs<lb/>
on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed<lb/>
its back was adorned with a large painting, repre-<lb/>
senting a gallant ship beating against a terrible<lb/>
storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy<lb/>
breakers. But high above the flying scud and<lb/>
dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of<lb/>
sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel&#x0027;s face;<lb/>
and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance<lb/>
upon the ship&#x0027;s tossed deck, something like that<lb/>
silver plate now inserted into the Victory&#x0027;s plank<lb/>
where Nelson fell. &#x201C;Ah, noble ship!&#x201D; the angel<lb/>
seemed to say, &#x201C;beat on, beat on, thou noble ship,<lb/>
and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking<lb/>
through; the clouds are rolling off; serenest azure<lb/>
is at hand.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the<lb/>
same sea taste that had achieved the ladder and<lb/>
the picture. Its panelled front was in the likeness<lb/>
of a ship&#x0027;s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested<lb/>
on a projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after<lb/>
a ship&#x0027;s fiddle-headed beak.</p>
<p>What could be more full of meaning?&#x2014;for the<lb/>
pulpit is ever this earth&#x0027;s foremost part; all the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n80" n="63"/>
rest comes in its rear: the pulpit leads the world.<lb/>
From thence it is that the storm&#x0027;s quick wrath is<lb/>
first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest<lb/>
brunt. From thence it is that the God of breezes,<lb/>
fair or foul, is first invoked for favourable winds.<lb/>
Yes, the world&#x0027;s a ship on its passage out, and not<lb/>
a voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d9" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER IX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the sermon</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Father Mapple</hi> rose, and in a mild voice of<lb/>
unassuming authority ordered the scattered people<lb/>
to condense. &#x201C;Starboard gangway, there! side<lb/>
away to larboard&#x2014;larboard gangway to starboard!<lb/>
Midships! midships!&#x201D;</p>
<p>There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots<lb/>
among the benches, and a still slighter shuffling of<lb/>
women&#x0027;s shoes, and all was quiet again, and every<lb/>
eye on the preacher.</p>
<p>He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit&#x0027;s<lb/>
bows, folded his large brown hands across his chest,<lb/>
uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so<lb/>
deeply devout, that he seemed kneeling and pray-<lb/>
ing at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<pb xml:id="n81" n="64"/>
<p>This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the<lb/>
continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foun-<lb/>
dering at sea in a fog&#x2014;in such tones he commenced<lb/>
reading the following hymn; but changing his<lb/>
manner towards the concluding stanzas, burst<lb/>
forth with a pealing exultation and joy&#x2014;</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>&#x201C;The ribs and terrors in the whale,</l>
<l rend="indent">Arch&#x0027;d over me a dismal gloom,</l>
<l>While all God&#x0027;s sunlit waves roll&#x0027;d by,</l>
<l rend="indent">And left me deepening down to doom.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="verse">
<l>&#x201C;I saw the open maw of hell,</l>
<l rend="indent">With endless pains and sorrows there;</l>
<l>Which none but they that feel can tell&#x2014;</l>
<l rend="indent">Oh, I was plunging to despair!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="verse">
<l>&#x201C;In black distress, I call&#x0027;d my God,</l>
<l rend="indent">When I could scarce believe Him mine,</l>
<l>He bow&#x0027;d his ear to my complaints&#x2014;</l>
<l rend="indent">No more the whale did me confine.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="verse">
<l>&#x201C;With speed he flew to my relief,</l>

<l>Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone</l>
<l rend="indent">The face of my Deliverer God.</l>

<l rend="indent">That terrible, that joyful hour;</l>
<l>I give the glory to my God;</l>
<l rend="indent">His all the mercy and the power.&#x201D;</l>
</lg>
<p>Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which<lb/>
swelled high above the howling of the storm. A<lb/>
brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned<lb/>
over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his<lb/>
hand down upon the proper page, said: &#x201C;Beloved<lb/>
shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n82" n="65"/>
of Jonah&#x2014; &#x2018;And God had prepared a great fish<lb/>
to swallow up Jonah.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Shipmates, this book, containing only four<lb/>
chapters&#x2014;four yarns&#x2014;is one of the smallest<lb/>
strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.<lb/>
Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah&#x0027;s deep<lb/>
sea-line sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is<lb/>
this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle<lb/>
in the fish&#x0027;s belly! How billow-like and bois-<lb/>
terously grand! We feel the floods surging over<lb/>
us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the<lb/>
waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is<lb/>
about us! But <hi rend="i">what</hi> is this lesson that the book<lb/>
of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded<lb/>
lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a<lb/>
lesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As<lb/>
sinful men, it is a lesson to us all; because it is<lb/>
a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly<lb/>
awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance,<lb/>
prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.<lb/>
As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of<lb/>
Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the com-<lb/>
mand of God&#x2014;never mind now what that com-<lb/>
mand was, or how conveyed&#x2014;which he found a<lb/>
hard command. But all the things that God<lb/>
would have us do are hard for us to do&#x2014;remember<lb/>
that&#x2014;and hence, he oftener commands us than<lb/>
endeavours to persuade. And if we obey God,<lb/>
we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this dis-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n83" n="66"/>
obeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obey-<lb/>
ing God consists.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah<lb/>
still further flouts at God, by seeking to flee from<lb/>
Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will<lb/>
carry him into countries where God does not<lb/>
reign, but only the Captains of this earth. He<lb/>
skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a<lb/>
ship that&#x0027;s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, per-<lb/>
haps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all<lb/>
accounts Tarshish could have been no other city<lb/>
than the modern Cadiz. That&#x0027;s the opinion of<lb/>
learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates?<lb/>
Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as<lb/>
Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient<lb/>
days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown<lb/>
sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates,<lb/>
is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,<lb/>
the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two<lb/>
thousand miles to the westward from that, just<lb/>
outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not then,<lb/>
shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide<lb/>
from God? Miserable man! Oh! most con-<lb/>
temptible and worthy of all scorn; with slouched<lb/>
hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowl-<lb/>
ing among the shipping like a vile burglar hasten-<lb/>
ing to cross the seas. So disordered, self-con-<lb/>
demning is his look, that had there been policemen<lb/>
in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n84" n="67"/>
something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched<lb/>
a deck. How plainly he&#x0027;s a fugitive! no baggage!<lb/>
not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,&#x2014;no friends<lb/>
accompany him to the wharf with their adieux.<lb/>
At last, after much dodging search, he finds the<lb/>
Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo;<lb/>
and as he steps on board to see its captain in the<lb/>
cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from<lb/>
hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger&#x0027;s evil<lb/>
eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look<lb/>
all case and confidence; in vain essays his wretched<lb/>
smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the<lb/>
mariners he can be no innocent. In their game-<lb/>
some but still serious way, one whispers to the<lb/>
other&#x2014; &#x2018;Jack, he&#x0027;s robbed a widow;&#x2019; or, &#x2018;Joe, do<lb/>
you mark him; he&#x0027;s a bigamist;&#x2019; or, &#x2018;Harry, lad,<lb/>
I guess he&#x0027;s the adulterer that broke jail in old<lb/>
Gomorrah; or belike, one of the missing mur-<lb/>
derers from Sodom.&#x2019; Another runs to read the<lb/>
bill that&#x0027;s stuck against the spile upon the wharf<lb/>
to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred<lb/>
gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide,<lb/>
and containing a description of his person. He<lb/>
reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all<lb/>
his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah,<lb/>
prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted<lb/>
Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness<lb/>
to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.<lb/>
He will not confess himself suspected; but that itself<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n85" n="68"/>
is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it;<lb/>
and when the sailors find him not to be the man<lb/>
that is advertised, they let him pass, and he<lb/>
descends into the cabin.</p>
<p>&#x201C; &#x2018;Who&#x0027;s there?&#x2019; cries the captain at his busy<lb/>
desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the<lb/>
Customs&#x2014;&#x2018;Who&#x0027;s there?&#x2019; Oh! how that harm-<lb/>
less question mangles Jonah! For the instant he<lb/>
almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. &#x2018;I seek<lb/>
a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail<lb/>
ye, sir?&#x2019; Thus far the busy captain had not<lb/>
looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands<lb/>
before him; but no sooner does he hear that<lb/>
hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinising glance.<lb/>
&#x2018;We sail with the next coming tide,&#x2019; at last he<lb/>
slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. &#x2018;No<lb/>
sooner, sir?&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2018;Soon enough for any honest man<lb/>
that goes a passenger. Ha! Jonah, that&#x0027;s another<lb/>
stab. But he swiftly calls away the captain from<lb/>
that scent. &#x2018;I&#x0027;ll sail with ye,&#x2019;&#x2014;he says,&#x2014;&#x2018;the<lb/>
passage money, how much is that?&#x2014;I&#x0027;ll pay now.&#x2019;<lb/>
For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it<lb/>
were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,<lb/>
&#x2018;that he paid the fare thereof&#x2019; ere the craft did<lb/>
sail. And taken with the context, this is full of<lb/>
meaning.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, Jonah&#x0027;s Captain, shipmates, was one<lb/>
whose discernment detects crime in any, but whose<lb/>
cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n86" n="69"/>
world, shipmates, Sin that pays its way can travel<lb/>
freely, and without a passport; whereas Virtue, if<lb/>
a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah&#x0027;s<lb/>
Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah&#x0027;s<lb/>
purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him<lb/>
thrice the usual sum; and it&#x0027;s assented to. Then<lb/>
the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive; but at<lb/>
the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its<lb/>
rear with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his<lb/>
purse, prudent suspicions still molest the Captain.<lb/>
He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. &#x2018;Not<lb/>
a forger, any way,&#x2019; he mutters; and Jonah is put<lb/>
down for his passage. &#x2018;Point out my state-room,<lb/>
sir,&#x2019; says Jonah now, &#x2018;I&#x0027;m travel-weary; I need<lb/>
sleep.&#x2019; &#x2018;Thou lookst like it,&#x2019; says the Captain,<lb/>
&#x2018;there&#x0027;s thy room.&#x2019; Jonah enters, and would lock<lb/>
the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing<lb/>
him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs<lb/>
lowly to himself, and mutters something about<lb/>
the doors of convicts&#x0027; cells being never allowed to<lb/>
be locked within. All dressed and dusty as he is,<lb/>
Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the<lb/>
little state-room ceiling almost resting on his fore-<lb/>
head. The air is close, and Jonah gasps. Then,<lb/>
in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the<lb/>
ship&#x0027;s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presen-<lb/>
timent of that stifling hour, when the whale shall<lb/>
hold him in the smallest of his bowel&#x0027;s wards.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Screwed at its axis against the side, a swing-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n87" n="70"/>
ing lamp slightly oscillates in Jonah&#x0027;s room; and<lb/>
the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the<lb/>
weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame<lb/>
and all, though in slight motion, still maintains a<lb/>
permanent obliquity with reference to the room;<lb/>
though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it but<lb/>
made obvious the false, lying levels among which<lb/>
it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah,<lb/>
as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round<lb/>
the place; and this thus far successful fugitive finds<lb/>
no refuge for his restless glance. But that contra-<lb/>
diction in the lamp more and more appals him.<lb/>
The floor, the ceiling, and the side are all awry.<lb/>
&#x2018;Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!&#x2019; he groans,<lb/>
&#x2018;straight upward, so it burns; but the chambers<lb/>
of my soul are all in crookedness!&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Like one who after a night of drunken revelry<lb/>
hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience<lb/>
yet pricking him; as the plungings of the Roman<lb/>
race-horse but so much the more strike his steel<lb/>
tags into him; as one who in that miserable plight<lb/>
still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying<lb/>
God for annihilation, until the fit be passed; and,<lb/>
at last, amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep<lb/>
stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds<lb/>
to death&#x2014;for conscience is the wound, and there&#x0027;s<lb/>
nought to stanch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his<lb/>
berth, Jonah&#x0027;s prodigy of ponderous misery drags<lb/>
him drowning down to sleep.</p>
<pb xml:id="n88" n="71"/>
<p>&#x201C;And now the time of tide has come; the ship<lb/>
casts off her cables; and from the deserted wharf<lb/>
the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,<lb/>
glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first<lb/>
of recorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.<lb/>
But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked<lb/>
burden. A dreadful storm comes on; the ship is<lb/>
like to break. But now, when the boatswain calls<lb/>
all hands to lighten her; when boxes, bales, and<lb/>
jars are tumbling overboard; when the wind is<lb/>
shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every<lb/>
plank thunders with trampling feet right over<lb/>
Jonah&#x0027;s head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah<lb/>
sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky<lb/>
and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and<lb/>
little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the<lb/>
mighty whale, which, even now, with open mouth,<lb/>
is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates,<lb/>
Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship&#x2014;<lb/>
a berth in the cabin, as I have taken it&#x2014;and was<lb/>
fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to<lb/>
him, and shrieks in his dead ear, &#x2018;What meanest<lb/>
thou, O sleeper! arise!&#x2019; Startled from his lethargy<lb/>
by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and<lb/>
stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out<lb/>
upon the sea. But at that moment he is sprung<lb/>
upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks.<lb/>
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and find-<lb/>
ing no speedy vent, runs roaring fore and aft, till<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n89" n="72"/>
the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet<lb/>
afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her<lb/>
affrighted face from the steep gullies in the black-<lb/>
ness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bow-<lb/>
sprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward<lb/>
again towards the tormented deep.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Terrors upon terrors run shouting through<lb/>
his soul. In all his cringing attitudes, the God-<lb/>
fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors<lb/>
mark him; more and more certain grow their<lb/>
suspicions of him; and at last, fully to test the<lb/>
truth, by referring the whole matter to high<lb/>
Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose<lb/>
cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot<lb/>
is Jonah&#x0027;s; that discovered, then how furiously<lb/>
they mob him with their questions. &#x2018;What is<lb/>
thine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy<lb/>
country? What people?&#x2019; But mark now, my<lb/>
shipmates, the behaviour of poor Jonah. The<lb/>
eager mariners but ask him who he is, and where<lb/>
from; whereas, they not only receive an answer<lb/>
to those questions, but likewise another answer to<lb/>
a question not put by them; but the unsolicited<lb/>
answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of<lb/>
God that is upon him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;&#x2018;I am a Hebrew,&#x2019; he cries&#x2014;and then&#x2014;&#x2018;I<lb/>
fear the Lord, the God of Heaven, who hath made<lb/>
the sea and the dry land!&#x2019; Fear him, O Jonah?<lb/>
Aye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God <hi rend="i">then</hi>!<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n90" n="73"/>
Straightway, he now goes on to make a full con-<lb/>
fession; whereupon the mariners become more<lb/>
and more appalled, but still are pitiful. For when<lb/>
Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy&#x2014;since<lb/>
he but too well knew the darkness of his deserts,&#x2014;<lb/>
when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take<lb/>
him and cast him forth into the sea, for he knew<lb/>
that for <hi rend="i">his</hi> sake this great tempest was upon<lb/>
them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek<lb/>
by other means to save the ship. But all in vain;<lb/>
the indignant gale howls louder; then, with one<lb/>
hand raised invokingly to God, with the other<lb/>
they not unreluctantly lay hold upon Jonah.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And now, behold Jonah taken up as an anchor<lb/>
and dropped into the sea; when instantly an oily<lb/>
calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is<lb/>
still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him,<lb/>
leaving smooth water behind. He goes down in<lb/>
the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion<lb/>
that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops<lb/>
seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him;<lb/>
and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so<lb/>
many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah<lb/>
prayed unto the Lord out of the fish&#x0027;s belly. But<lb/>
observe his prayer, and learn a weighty lesson.<lb/>
For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail<lb/>
for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful<lb/>
punishment is just. He leaves all his deliverance<lb/>
to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n91" n="74"/>
all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards<lb/>
His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true<lb/>
and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon,<lb/>
but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing<lb/>
to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in<lb/>
the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and<lb/>
the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah<lb/>
before you to be copied for his sin, but I do place<lb/>
him before you as a model for repentance. Sin<lb/>
not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it, like<lb/>
Jonah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While he was speaking these words, the howling<lb/>
of the shrieking, slanting storm without seemed<lb/>
to add new power to the preacher, who, when<lb/>
describing Jonah&#x0027;s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a<lb/>
storm himself. His deep chest heaved, as with<lb/>
a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the war-<lb/>
ring elements at work; and the thunders that<lb/>
rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the<lb/>
light leaping from his eye, made all his simple<lb/>
hearers look on him with a quick fear that was<lb/>
strange to them.</p>
<p>There now came a lull in his look, as he silently<lb/>
turned over the leaves of the book once more;<lb/>
and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes,<lb/>
for the moment, seemed communing with his<lb/>
God.</p>
<p>But again he leaned over towards the people,<lb/>
and bowing his head lowly, with an aspect of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n92" n="75"/>
deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these<lb/>
words:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon<lb/>
you; both his hands press upon me. I have read<lb/>
ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson<lb/>
that Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore<lb/>
to ye, and still more to me&#x2014;for I am a greater<lb/>
sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I<lb/>
come down from this mast-head and sit on the<lb/>
hatches there where you sit, and listen as you<lb/>
listen, while some one of you reads <hi rend="i">me</hi> that other<lb/>
and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to <hi rend="i">me</hi>,<lb/>
as a pilot of the living God. How being an<lb/>
anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things,<lb/>
and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome<lb/>
truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah,<lb/>
appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled from<lb/>
his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his<lb/>
God by taking ship at Joppa. But God is every-<lb/>
where: Tarshish he never reached. As we have<lb/>
seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swal-<lb/>
lowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with<lb/>
swift slantings tore him along &#x2018;into the midst of<lb/>
the seas,&#x2019; where the eddying depths sucked him<lb/>
ten thousand fathoms down, and &#x2018;the weeds were<lb/>
wrapped about his head,&#x2019; and all the watery world<lb/>
of woe bowled over him. Yet even then, beyond<lb/>
the reach of any plummet&#x2014;&#x2018;out of the belly of<lb/>
hell&#x2019;&#x2014;when the whale grounded upon the ocean&#x0027;s<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n93" n="76"/>
utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed,<lb/>
repenting prophet when he cried. Then God<lb/>
spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold<lb/>
and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching<lb/>
up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all<lb/>
the delights of air and earth; and &#x2018;vomited out<lb/>
Jonah upon the dry land;&#x2019; when the word of the<lb/>
Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised<lb/>
and beaten&#x2014;his ears, like two sea-shells, still<lb/>
multitudinously murmuring of the ocean&#x2014;Jonah<lb/>
did the Almighty&#x0027;s bidding. And what was that,<lb/>
shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of<lb/>
Falsehood! That was it!</p>
<p>&#x201C;This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and<lb/>
woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it!<lb/>
Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel<lb/>
duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon<lb/>
the waters when God has brewed them into a<lb/>
gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather<lb/>
than to appal! Woe to him whose good name<lb/>
is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who,<lb/>
in this world, courts not dishonour! Woe to him<lb/>
who would not be true, even though to be false<lb/>
were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the<lb/>
great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others<lb/>
is himself a castaway!&#x201D;</p>
<p>He drooped and fell away from himself for a<lb/>
moment; then, lifting his face to them again,<lb/>
showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n94" n="77"/>
a heavenly enthusiasm,&#x2014; &#x201C;But oh! shipmates!<lb/>
on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a<lb/>
sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,<lb/>
than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the<lb/>
main-truck higher than the keelson is low? De-<lb/>
light is to him&#x2014;a far, far upward, and inward<lb/>
delight&#x2014;who, against the proud gods and commo-<lb/>
dores of this earth, ever stands forth his own<lb/>
inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong<lb/>
arms yet support him, when the ship of this base<lb/>
treacherous world has gone down beneath him.<lb/>
Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the<lb/>
truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin, though<lb/>
he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators<lb/>
and Judges. Delight,&#x2014;top-gallant delight is to<lb/>
him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the<lb/>
Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven.<lb/>
Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the bil-<lb/>
lows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never<lb/>
shake from this sure Keel of the Ages. And<lb/>
eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who<lb/>
coming to lay him down, can say with his final<lb/>
breath&#x2014; &#x2018;O Father!&#x2014;chiefly known to me by<lb/>
Thy rod&#x2014;mortal or immortal, here I die. I have<lb/>
striven to be Thine, more than to be this world&#x0027;s,<lb/>
or mine own. Yet this is nothing; I leave eter-<lb/>
nity to Thee; for what is man that he should live<lb/>
out the lifetime of his God?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>He said no more, but slowly waving a benedic-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n95" n="78"/>
tion, covered his face with his hands, and so re-<lb/>
mained kneeling, till all the people had departed,<lb/>
and he was left alone in the place.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d10" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER X.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">a bosom friend</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Returning</hi> to the Spouter-Inn from the chapel,<lb/>
I found Queequeg there quite alone; he having<lb/>
left the chapel before the benediction some time.<lb/>
He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with<lb/>
his feet on the stove hearth, and in one hand was<lb/>
holding close up to his face that little negro idol<lb/>
of his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-<lb/>
knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile<lb/>
humming to himself in his heathenish way.</p>
<p>But being now interrupted, he put up the<lb/>
image; and pretty soon, going to the table, took<lb/>
up a large book there, and placing it on his lap,<lb/>
began counting the pages with deliberate regu-<lb/>
larity; at every fiftieth page&#x2014;as I fancied&#x2014;stop-<lb/>
ping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and<lb/>
giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle<lb/>
of astonishment. He would then begin again at<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n96" n="79"/>
the next fifty; seeming to commence at number<lb/>
one each time, as though he could not count<lb/>
more than fifty, and it was only by such a large<lb/>
number of fifties being found together, that his<lb/>
astonishment at the multitude of pages was<lb/>
excited.</p>
<p>With much interest I sat watching him. Savage<lb/>
though he was, and hideously marred about the<lb/>
face&#x2014;at least to my taste&#x2014;his countenance yet<lb/>
had a something in it which was by no means dis-<lb/>
agreeable. You cannot hide the soul. Through<lb/>
all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the<lb/>
traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large,<lb/>
deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed<lb/>
tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils.<lb/>
And besides all this, there was a certain lofty<lb/>
bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouth-<lb/>
ness could not altogether maim. He looked like<lb/>
a man who had never cringed, and never had had<lb/>
a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head<lb/>
being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer<lb/>
and brighter relief, and looked more expansive<lb/>
than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to<lb/>
decide; but certain it was, his head was phren-<lb/>
ologically an excellent one. It may seem ridicu-<lb/>
lous, but it reminded me of General Washington&#x0027;s<lb/>
head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had<lb/>
the same long regularly graded retreating slope<lb/>
from above the brows, which were likewise very<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n97" n="80"/>
projecting, like two long promontories thickly<lb/>
wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washing-<lb/>
ton cannibalistically developed.</p>
<p>Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-<lb/>
pretending meanwhile to be looking out at the<lb/>
storm from the casement, he never heeded my<lb/>
presence, never troubled himself with so much as<lb/>
a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied<lb/>
with counting the pages of the marvellous book.<lb/>
Considering how sociably we had been sleeping<lb/>
together the previous night, and especially con-<lb/>
sidering the affectionate arm I had found thrown<lb/>
over me upon waking in the morning, I thought<lb/>
this indifference of his very strange. But savages<lb/>
are strange beings; at times you do not know<lb/>
exactly how to take them. At first they are over-<lb/>
awing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity<lb/>
seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed also that<lb/>
Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,<lb/>
with the other seamen in the inn. He made no<lb/>
advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to<lb/>
enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this<lb/>
struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second<lb/>
thoughts, there was something almost sublime in<lb/>
it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles<lb/>
from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is&#x2014;which<lb/>
was the only way he could get there&#x2014;thrown among<lb/>
people as strange to him as though he were in the<lb/>
planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n98" n="81"/>
ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content<lb/>
with his own companionship; always equal to<lb/>
himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philoso-<lb/>
phy; though no doubt he had never heard there<lb/>
was such a thing as that, But, perhaps, to be<lb/>
true philosophers, we mortals should not be con-<lb/>
scious of so living or so striving. So soon as I<lb/>
hear that such or such a man gives himself out<lb/>
for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dys-<lb/>
peptic old woman, he must have &#x201C;broken his<lb/>
digester.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As I sat there in that now lonely room, the fire<lb/>
burning low, in that mild stage when, after its<lb/>
first intensity has warmed the air, it then only<lb/>
glows to be looked at; the evening shades and<lb/>
phantoms gathering round the casements, and<lb/>
peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the<lb/>
storm booming without in solemn swells; I began<lb/>
to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melt-<lb/>
ing in me. No more my splintered heart and<lb/>
maddened hand were turned against the wolfish<lb/>
world. This soothing savage had redeemed it.<lb/>
There he sat, his very indifference speaking a<lb/>
nature in which there lurked no civilized hypo-<lb/>
crisies and bland deceits. Wild he was; a very<lb/>
sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself<lb/>
mysteriously drawn towards him. And those<lb/>
same things that would have repelled most others<lb/>
&#x2014;they were the very magnets that thus drew me.</p>
<p>E 3</p>
<pb xml:id="n99" n="82"/>
<p>I&#x0027;ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian<lb/>
kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew<lb/>
my bench near him, and made some friendly signs<lb/>
and hints, doing my best to talk with him mean-<lb/>
while. At first he little noticed these advances;<lb/>
but presently, upon my referring to his last night&#x0027;s<lb/>
hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we<lb/>
were again to be bedfellows. I told him, yes;<lb/>
whereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a<lb/>
little complimented.</p>
<p>We then turned over the book together, and I<lb/>
endeavoured to explain to him the purpose of the<lb/>
printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that<lb/>
were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and<lb/>
from that we went to jabbering the best we could<lb/>
about the various outer sights to be seen in this<lb/>
famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke;<lb/>
and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly<lb/>
offered me a puff. And there we sat exchanging<lb/>
puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it<lb/>
regularly passing between us.</p>
<p>If there yet lurked any ice of indifference<lb/>
towards me in the Pagan&#x0027;s breast, this pleasant,<lb/>
genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out and left<lb/>
us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as<lb/>
naturally and unbiddenly as I to him; and when<lb/>
our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against<lb/>
mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that<lb/>
henceforth we were married&#x2014;meaning, in his<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n100" n="83"/>
country&#x0027;s phrase, that we were bosom friends: he<lb/>
would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a<lb/>
countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would<lb/>
have seemed far too premature&#x2014;a thing to be<lb/>
much distrusted; but in this simple savage those<lb/>
old rules would not apply.</p>
<p>After supper, and another social chat and smoke,<lb/>
we went to our room together. He made me a<lb/>
present of his embalmed head; took out his enor-<lb/>
mous tobacco wallet, and groping under the<lb/>
tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver;<lb/>
then spreading them on the table, and mechanically<lb/>
dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one<lb/>
of them towards me, and said it was mine. I was<lb/>
going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by<lb/>
pouring them into my trowsers&#x0027; pockets. I let<lb/>
them stay. He then went about his evening<lb/>
prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper<lb/>
fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I<lb/>
thought he seemed anxious for me to join him;<lb/>
but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated<lb/>
a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would<lb/>
comply or otherwise.</p>
<p>I was a good Christian; born and bred in the<lb/>
bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church. How<lb/>
then could I unite with this wild idolater in<lb/>
worshipping his piece of wood? But what is<lb/>
worship? thought I&#x2014;But what is worship?&#x2014;<lb/>
to do the will of God&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that</hi> is worship. And<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n101" n="84"/>
what is the will of God?&#x2014;to do to my fellow<lb/>
man what I would have my fellow man to do to<lb/>
me&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that</hi> is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is<lb/>
my fellow man. And what do I wish that this<lb/>
Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me<lb/>
in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.<lb/>
Consequently, I must then unite with him in his;<lb/>
ergo, I must turn idolater. So I kindled the<lb/>
shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol;<lb/>
offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salaamed<lb/>
before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and<lb/>
that done, we undressed and went to bed, at<lb/>
peace with our own consciences and all the world.<lb/>
But we did not go to sleep without some little<lb/>
chat.</p>
<p>How it is I know not, but there is no place like<lb/>
a bed for confidential disclosures between friends.<lb/>
Man and wife, they say, there open the very<lb/>
bottom of their souls to each other; and some<lb/>
old couples often lie and chat over old times till<lb/>
nearly morning. Thus, then, lay I and Queequeg<lb/>
&#x2014;a cosy, loving pair.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">We</hi> had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping<lb/>
at short intervals, when, at last, by reason of our<lb/>
confabulations, what little nappishness remained<lb/>
in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting<lb/>
up again, though daybreak was yet some way down<lb/>
the future.</p>
<p>Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so, that<lb/>
our recumbent position began to grow wearisome,<lb/>
and by little and little we found ourselves sitting<lb/>
up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning<lb/>
against the head-board with our four knees drawn<lb/>
up close together, and our two noses bending over<lb/>
them, as if our knee-pans were warming-pans.<lb/>
We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it<lb/>
was so chilly out of doors; indeed, out of bed-<lb/>
clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the<lb/>
room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy<lb/>
bodily warmth, some small part of you must be<lb/>
cold; for there is no quality in this world that is<lb/>
not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists<lb/>
in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n103" n="86"/>
over comfortable, and have been so a long time,<lb/>
then you cannot be said to be comfortable any<lb/>
more. But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,<lb/>
the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be<lb/>
slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general<lb/>
consciousness, you feel most delightfully and un-<lb/>
mistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping<lb/>
apartment should never be furnished with a fire,<lb/>
which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the<lb/>
rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness<lb/>
is to have nothing but the blanket between you<lb/>
and your snugness, and the cold of the outer air.<lb/>
Then, there you lie like the one warm spark in<lb/>
the heart of an arctic crystal.</p>
<p>We had been sitting in this crouching manner<lb/>
for some time, when all at once I thought I would<lb/>
open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether<lb/>
by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake,<lb/>
I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut, in<lb/>
order the more to concentrate the snugness of<lb/>
being in bed: because no man can ever feel his<lb/>
own identity aright except his eyes be closed; as<lb/>
if darkness were indeed the proper element of our<lb/>
essences, though light be more congenial to our<lb/>
clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and<lb/>
coming out of my own pleasant and self-created<lb/>
darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom<lb/>
of the unilluminated twelve-o&#x0027;clock-at-night, I<lb/>
experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n104" n="87"/>
at all object to the hint from Queequeg that per-<lb/>
haps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we<lb/>
were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong<lb/>
desire to have a few quiet puffs from his toma-<lb/>
hawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a<lb/>
strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the<lb/>
night before, yet see how elastic our stiff preju-<lb/>
dices grow when love once comes to bend them!<lb/>
For now I liked nothing better than to have<lb/>
Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because<lb/>
he seemed to be full of such serene household joy<lb/>
then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the<lb/>
landlord&#x0027;s policy of insurance. I was only alive<lb/>
to the condensed confidential comfortableness of<lb/>
sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.<lb/>
With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoul-<lb/>
ders, we now passed the tomahawk from one to the<lb/>
other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging<lb/>
tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the<lb/>
new-lit lamp.</p>
<p>Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled<lb/>
the savage away to far distant scenes, I know not,<lb/>
but he now spoke of his native Island; and, eager<lb/>
to hear his history, I begged him to go on and<lb/>
tell it. He gladly complied. Though at the time<lb/>
I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet<lb/>
subsequent disclosures, when I had become more<lb/>
familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable<lb/>
me to present the whole story, such as it may<lb/>
prove in the mere skeleton I give.</p>

<p>While yet a new-hatched savage, running wild<lb/>
about his native woodlands in a grass clout, fol-<lb/>
lowed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green<lb/>

father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High<lb/>

who were the wives of unconquerable warriors.<lb/>
There was excellent blood in his veins&#x2014;royal<lb/>
stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal<lb/>
propensity he nourished in his untutored youth.</p>
<p>A Sag Harbour ship visited his father&#x0027;s bay, and<lb/>
Queequeg sought a passage to Christian lands.<lb/>
But the ship, having her full complement of sea-<lb/>
men, spurned his suit; and not all the King his<lb/>
father&#x0027;s influence could prevail. But Queequeg<lb/>
vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n106" n="89"/>
to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must<lb/>
pass through when she quitted the island. On<lb/>
one side was a coral reef; on the other a low<lb/>
tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets<lb/>
that grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe,<lb/>
still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow<lb/>
seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in<lb/>
hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a<lb/>
flash he darted out; gained her side; with one<lb/>
backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his<lb/>
canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing<lb/>
himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a<lb/>
ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though<lb/>
hacked in pieces.</p>
<p>In vain the captain threatened to throw him<lb/>
overboard; suspended a cutlass over his naked<lb/>
wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and<lb/>
Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate<lb/>
dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit Chris-<lb/>
tendom, the captain at last relented, and told him<lb/>
he might make himself at home. But this fine<lb/>
young savage&#x2014;this sea Prince of Wales&#x2014;never<lb/>
saw the captain&#x0027;s cabin. They put him down<lb/>
among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.<lb/>
But like the Czar Peter, content to toil in the<lb/>
shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no<lb/>
seeming ignominy, if thereby he might haply<lb/>
gain the power of enlightening his untutored<lb/>
countrymen. For at bottom&#x2014;so he told me&#x2014;he<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n107" n="90"/>
was actuated by a profound desire to learn among<lb/>
the Christians the arts whereby to make his<lb/>
people still happier than they were; and more<lb/>
than that, still better than they were. But, alas!<lb/>
the practices of whalemen soon convinced him<lb/>
that even Christians could be both miserable and<lb/>
wicked; infinitely more so than all his father&#x0027;s<lb/>
heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbour,<lb/>
and seeing what the sailors did there, and then<lb/>
going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent<lb/>
their wages in <hi rend="i">that</hi> place also, poor Queequeg gave<lb/>
it up for lost. Thought he, it&#x0027;s a wicked world in<lb/>
all meridians; I&#x0027;ll die a pagan.</p>
<p>And thus an old idolater at heart, he yet lived<lb/>
among these Christians, wore their clothes, and<lb/>
tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer<lb/>
ways about him, though now some time from<lb/>
home.</p>
<p>By hints, I asked him whether he did not pro-<lb/>
pose going back, and having a coronation; since<lb/>
he might now consider his father dead and gone,<lb/>
he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.<lb/>
He answered, no, not yet; and added that he was<lb/>
fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had un-<lb/>
fitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled<lb/>
throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by-<lb/>
and-by, he said he would return,&#x2014;as soon as he felt<lb/>
himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he<lb/>
proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n108" n="91"/>
four oceans. They had made a harpooneer of<lb/>
him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre<lb/>
now.</p>
<p>I asked him what might be his immediate<lb/>
purpose, teaching his future movements. He<lb/>
answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.<lb/>
Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own<lb/>
design, and informed him of my intention to sail<lb/>
out of Nantucket, as being the most promising<lb/>
port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.<lb/>
He at once resolved to accompany me to that<lb/>
island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the<lb/>
same watch, the same boat, the same mess with<lb/>
me, in short to share my every hap; with both<lb/>
my hands in his, boldly dip into the potluck of<lb/>
both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for<lb/>
besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg,<lb/>
he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,<lb/>
could not fail to be of great usefulness to one,<lb/>
who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries<lb/>
of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea,<lb/>
as known to merchant seamen.</p>
<p>His story being ended with his pipe&#x0027;s last dying<lb/>
puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead<lb/>
against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled<lb/>
over from each other, this way and that, and very<lb/>
soon were sleeping.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">wheelbarrow</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Next</hi> morning, Monday, after disposing of the<lb/>
embalmed head to a barber, for a block, I settled<lb/>
my own and comrade&#x0027;s bill; using, however, my<lb/>
comrade&#x0027;s money. The grinning landlord, as well<lb/>
as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the<lb/>
sudden friendship which had sprung up between<lb/>
me and Queequeg&#x2014;especially as Peter Coffin&#x0027;s<lb/>
cock-and-bull stories had previously so much<lb/>
alarmed me about him.</p>
<p>We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking<lb/>
our things, including my own poor carpet-bag,<lb/>
and Queequeg&#x0027;s canvas sack and hammock, away<lb/>
we went down to &#x201C;the Moss,&#x201D; the little Nan-<lb/>
tucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As<lb/>
we were going along the people stared; not at<lb/>
Queequeg so much&#x2014;for they were used to seeing<lb/>
cannibals like him in their streets,&#x2014;but at see-<lb/>
ing him and me upon such confidential terms.<lb/>
But we heeded them not, going along wheeling<lb/>
the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n110" n="93"/>
stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon<lb/>
barbs. I asked him why he carried such a trou-<lb/>
blesome thing with him ashore, and whether all<lb/>
whaling ships did not find their own harpoons.<lb/>
To this, in substance, he replied, that though<lb/>
what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a par-<lb/>
ticular affection for his own harpoon, because it<lb/>
was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal<lb/>
combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of<lb/>
whales. In short, like many inland reapers and<lb/>
mowers, who go into the farmers&#x0027; meadows armed<lb/>
with their own scythes&#x2014;though in no wise obliged<lb/>
to furnish them&#x2014;even so, Queequeg, for his own<lb/>
private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.</p>
<p>Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he<lb/>
told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow<lb/>
he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbour. The<lb/>
owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in<lb/>
which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding-<lb/>
house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing&#x2014;<lb/>
though in truth he was entirely so, concerning<lb/>
the precise way in which to manage the barrow&#x2014;<lb/>
Queequeg puts his chest upon it, lashes it fast,<lb/>
and then shoulders the barrow, and marches up<lb/>
the wharf. &#x201C;Why,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;Queequeg, you<lb/>
might have known better than that, one would<lb/>
think. Didn&#x0027;t the people laugh?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon this, he told me another story. The<lb/>
people of his island of Kokovoko, it seems, at their<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n111" n="94"/>
wedding feasts, express the fragrant water of young<lb/>
cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a<lb/>
punchbowl, and this punchbowl always forms the<lb/>
great central ornament on the braided mat where<lb/>
the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant<lb/>
ship once touched at Kokovoko, and its com-<lb/>
mander&#x2014;from all accounts, a very stately, punc-<lb/>
tilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain&#x2014;this<lb/>
commander was invited to the wedding feast of<lb/>
Queequeg&#x0027;s sister, a pretty young princess just<lb/>
turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding<lb/>
guests were assembled at the bride&#x0027;s bamboo cot-<lb/>
tage, this captain marches in, and being assigned<lb/>
the post of honour, placed himself over against<lb/>
the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and<lb/>
his majesty the King, Queequeg&#x0027;s father. Grace<lb/>
being said&#x2014;for those people have their grace as<lb/>
well as we&#x2014;though Queequeg told me that, un-<lb/>
like us, who at such times look downwards to our<lb/>
platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks,<lb/>
glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts;&#x2014;<lb/>
Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens<lb/>
the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the<lb/>
island; that is, dipping his consecrated and con-<lb/>
secrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed<lb/>
beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next<lb/>
the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking<lb/>
himself&#x2014;being captain of a ship&#x2014;as having plain<lb/>
precedence over a mere island king, especially in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n112" n="95"/>
the king&#x0027;s own house&#x2014;the captain coolly proceeds<lb/>
to wash his hands in the punchbowl; taking it,<lb/>
I suppose, for a huge finger-glass. &#x201C;Now,&#x201D; said<lb/>
Queequeg, &#x201C;what you tink now? Didn&#x0027;t our<lb/>
people laugh?&#x201D;</p>
<p>At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we<lb/>
stood on board the schooner. Hoisting sail, it<lb/>
glided down the Acushnet River. On one side,<lb/>
New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-<lb/>
covered trees all glittering in the clear, cold air.<lb/>
Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were<lb/>
piled upon her wharves, and side by side the<lb/>
world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely<lb/>
moored at last; while from others came a sound<lb/>
of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of<lb/>
fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening<lb/>
that new cruises were on the start; that one most<lb/>
perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a<lb/>
second; and a second ended, only begins a third;<lb/>
and so on, for ever and for aye. Such is the<lb/>
endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly<lb/>
effort.</p>
<p>Gaining the more open water, the bracing<lb/>
breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss tossed the<lb/>
quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his<lb/>
snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!&#x2014;how<lb/>
I spurned that turnpike earth!&#x2014;that common<lb/>
highway, all over dented with the marks of slavish<lb/>
heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n113" n="96"/>
magnanimity of the sea which will permit no<lb/>
records.</p>
<p>At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed<lb/>
to drink and reel with me. His dusky nostrils<lb/>
swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed<lb/>
teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained,<lb/>
the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and<lb/>
dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Side-<lb/>
ways leaning, we sideways darted, every ropeyarn<lb/>
tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling<lb/>
like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of<lb/>
this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the<lb/>
plunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not<lb/>
notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a<lb/>
lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two<lb/>
fellow beings should be so companionable; as<lb/>
though a white man were anything more dignified<lb/>
than a whitewashed negro. But there were some<lb/>
boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense<lb/>
greenness, must have come from the heart and<lb/>
centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of<lb/>
these young saplings mimicking him behind his<lb/>
back. I thought the bumpkin&#x0027;s hour of doom<lb/>
was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny<lb/>
savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost<lb/>
miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high<lb/>
up bodily into the air; then, slightly tapping his<lb/>
stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with<lb/>
bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n114" n="97"/>
turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk<lb/>
pipe and passed it to me for a puff.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Capting! Capting!&#x201D; yelled the bumpkin,<lb/>
running towards that officer; &#x201C;Capting, Capting,<lb/>
here&#x0027;s the devil.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hallo, <hi rend="i">you</hi> sir,&#x201D; cried the Captain, a gaunt<lb/>
rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg, &#x201C;what<lb/>
in thunder do you mean by that? Don&#x0027;t you<lb/>
know you might have killed that chap?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What him say?&#x201D; said Queequeg, as he mildly<lb/>
turned to me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He say,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;that you came near kill-e<lb/>
that man there,&#x201D; pointing to the still shivering<lb/>
greenhorn.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Kill-e,&#x201D; cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed<lb/>
face into an unearthly expression of disdain; &#x201C;ah!<lb/>
him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so<lb/>
small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look you,&#x201D; roared the Captain, &#x201C;I&#x0027;ll kill-e<lb/>
<hi rend="i">you</hi>, you cannibal, if you try any more of your<lb/>
tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But it so happened just then, that it was high<lb/>
time for the Captain to mind his own eye. The<lb/>
prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted<lb/>
the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was<lb/>
now flying from side to side, completely sweeping<lb/>
the entire after-part of the deck. The poor<lb/>
fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly,<lb/>
was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n115" n="98"/>
and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,<lb/>
seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and<lb/>
back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and<lb/>
every instant seemed on the point of snapping<lb/>
into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing<lb/>
seemed capable of being done: those on deck<lb/>
rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the<lb/>
boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated<lb/>
whale. In the midst of this consternation, Quee-<lb/>
queg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling<lb/>
under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a<lb/>
rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then<lb/>
flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round<lb/>
the boom as it swept over his head, and at the<lb/>
next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all<lb/>
was safe. The schooner was run into the wind,<lb/>
and while the hands were clearing away the stern<lb/>
boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted<lb/>
from the side with a long living are of a leap.<lb/>
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming<lb/>
like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out<lb/>
before him, and by turns revealing his brawny<lb/>
shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked<lb/>
at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one<lb/>
to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down.<lb/>
Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,<lb/>
Queequeg now took an instant&#x0027;s glance around<lb/>
him, and seeming to see just how matters were,<lb/>
dived down and disappeared. A few minutes<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n116" n="99"/>
more, and he rose again, one arm still striking<lb/>
out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.<lb/>
The boat soon picked them up. The poor bump-<lb/>
kin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a<lb/>
noble trump; the captain begged his pardon.<lb/>
From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a<lb/>
barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last<lb/>
long dive.</p>
<p>Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did<lb/>
not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal<lb/>
from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.<lb/>
He only asked for water&#x2014;fresh water&#x2014;something<lb/>
to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry<lb/>
clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the<lb/>
bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him,<lb/>
seemed to be saying to himself&#x2014;&#x201D; It&#x0027;s a mutual,<lb/>
joint-stock world, in all meridians. We cannibals<lb/>
must help these Christiana.&#x201D;</p>

<hi rend="sc">nantucket</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Nothing</hi> more happened on the passage worthy<lb/>
the mentioning; so, after a fine run, we safely<lb/>
arrived in Nantucket.</p>
<p>Nantucket! Take out your map and look at<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n117" n="100"/>
it. See what a real corner of the world it occu-<lb/>
pies; how it stands there, away off shore, more<lb/>
lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at<lb/>
it&#x2014;a mere hillock and elbow of sand; all beach,<lb/>
without a background. There is more sand there<lb/>
than you would use in twenty years as a sub-<lb/>
stitute for blotting-paper. Some gamesome wights<lb/>
will tell you that they have to plant weeds there,<lb/>
they don&#x0027;t grow naturally; that they import<lb/>
Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond<lb/>
seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that<lb/>
pieces of wood in Nautucket are carried about<lb/>
like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people<lb/>
there plant toadstools before their houses, to get<lb/>
under the shade in summer time; that one blade<lb/>
of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day&#x0027;s<lb/>
walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes,<lb/>
something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they<lb/>
are so shut up, belted about, every way inclosed,<lb/>
surrounded, and made an utter island of by the<lb/>
ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small<lb/>
clams will sometimes be found adhering, as to the<lb/>
backs of sea turtles. But these extravagances<lb/>
only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.</p>
<p>Look now at the wondrous traditional story of<lb/>
how this island was settled by the red-men.<lb/>
Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle<lb/>
swooped down upon the New England coast, and<lb/>
carried off an infant Indian in his talons. With<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n118" n="101"/>
loud lament the parents saw their child borne out<lb/>
of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to<lb/>
follow in the same direction. Setting out in their<lb/>
canoes, after a perilous passage they discovered<lb/>
the island, and there found an empty ivory<lb/>
casket&#x2014;the poor little Indian&#x0027;s skeleton.</p>
<p>What wonder, then, that these Nautucketers,<lb/>
born on a beach, should take to the sea for a<lb/>
livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs<lb/>
in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with<lb/>
nets for mackerel; more experienced, they pushed<lb/>
off in boats and captured cod; and at last, launch-<lb/>
ing a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this<lb/>
watery world; put an incessant belt of circum-<lb/>
navigations round it; peeped in at Bearing&#x0027;s<lb/>
Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared<lb/>
everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass<lb/>
that has survived the flood; most monstrous and<lb/>
most mountainous&#x2014;that Himmalehan, salt-sea<lb/>
Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of<lb/>
unconscious power, that his very panics are more<lb/>
to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious<lb/>
assaults!</p>
<p>And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these<lb/>
sea hermits, issuing from their ant-hill in the sea,<lb/>
overrun and conquered the watery world like so<lb/>
many Alexanders; parcelling out among them<lb/>
the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the<lb/>
three pirate powers did Poland. Let America<lb/>
add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n119" n="102"/>
let the English overswarm all India, and hang out<lb/>
their blazing banner from the sun; two-thirds of<lb/>
this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer&#x0027;s. For<lb/>
the sea is his; he owns it, as emperors own<lb/>
empires, other seamen having but a right of way<lb/>
through, it. Merchant ships are but extension<lb/>
bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even<lb/>
pirates and privateers, though following the sea,<lb/>
as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other<lb/>
ships, other fragments of the land like them-<lb/>
selves, without seeking to draw their living from<lb/>
the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he<lb/>
alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in<lb/>
Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and<lb/>
fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.<lb/>
<hi rend="i">There</hi> is his home; <hi rend="i">there</hi> lies his business, which<lb/>
a Noah&#x0027;s flood would scarcely interrupt, though it<lb/>
overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives<lb/>
on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he<lb/>
hides among the waves; he climbs them as<lb/>
chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he<lb/>
knows not the land; so that when he comes to it<lb/>
at last, it smells like another world, more strangely<lb/>
than the moon would to an Earthsman. With<lb/>
the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings<lb/>
and is rocked to sleep between billows, so at<lb/>
nightfall, the Nantucketer out of sight of land,<lb/>
furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while<lb/>
under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and<lb/>
whales.</p>

<hi rend="sc">chowder</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was quite late in the evening when the little<lb/>
Moss came snugly to anchor, and Queequeg and<lb/>
I went ashore; so we could attend to no business<lb/>
that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.<lb/>
The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended<lb/>
us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Twy Pots,<lb/>
whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of<lb/>
the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and more-<lb/>
over he had assured us that cousin Hosea, as he<lb/>
called him, was famous for his chowders. In short,<lb/>
he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do<lb/>
better than try pot-luck at the Twy Pots. But<lb/>
the directions he had given us about keeping a<lb/>
yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we<lb/>
opened a white church to the larboard, and then<lb/>
keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a<lb/>
corner three points to the starboard, and that done,<lb/>
then ask the first man we met where the place<lb/>
was&#x2014;these crooked directions of his very much<lb/>
puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset,<lb/>
Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse, our<lb/>
first point of departure, must be left on the lar-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n121" n="104"/>
board hand, whereas I had understood Peter<lb/>
Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However,<lb/>
by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and<lb/>
now and then, knocking up a peaceable inhabitant<lb/>
to inquire the way, we at last came to something<lb/>
which there was no mistaking.</p>
<p>Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and<lb/>
suspended by asses&#x0027; ears, swung from the cross-<lb/>
trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old<lb/>
doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed<lb/>
off on the other side, so that this old top-mast<lb/>
looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was<lb/>
over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but<lb/>
I could not help staring at this gallows with a<lb/>
vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck<lb/>
as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,<lb/>
<hi rend="i">two</hi> of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.<lb/>
It&#x0027;s ominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper<lb/>
upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones<lb/>
staring at me in the whalemen&#x0027;s chapel; and here<lb/>
a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!<lb/>
Are these last throwing out oblique hints touching<lb/>
Tophet?</p>
<p>I was called from these reflections by the sight<lb/>
of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow<lb/>
gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a<lb/>
dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much<lb/>
like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scold-<lb/>
ing with a man in a purple woollen shirt.</p>
<pb xml:id="n122" n="105"/>
<p>&#x201C;Get along with ye,&#x201D; said she to the man, &#x201C;or<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll be combing ye!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come on, Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;all right.<lb/>
There&#x0027;s Mrs. Hussey.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being<lb/>
from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey entirely<lb/>
competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon<lb/>
making known our desires for a supper and a bed,<lb/>
Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the<lb/>
present, ushered us into a little room, and seating<lb/>
us at a table spread with the relics of a recently<lb/>
concluded repast, turned round to us and said&#x2014;&#x201C;<lb/>
Clam or Cod?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s that about Cods, ma&#x0027;am?&#x201D; said I, with<lb/>
much politeness.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Clam or Cod?&#x201D; she repeated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;A clam for supper? a cold clam; is <hi rend="i">that</hi> what<lb/>
you mean, Mrs. Hussey?&#x201D; says I; &#x201C;but that&#x0027;s<lb/>
a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter<lb/>
time, ain&#x0027;t it, Mrs. Hussey?&#x201D;</p>
<p>But being in a great hurry to resume scolding<lb/>
the man in the purple shirt, who was waiting for<lb/>
it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but<lb/>
the word &#x201C;clam,&#x201D; Mrs. Hussey hurried towards<lb/>
an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling<lb/>
out &#x201C;clam for two,&#x201D; disappeared.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;do you think that we<lb/>
can make out a supper for us ooth on one clam?&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, a warm savoury steam from the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n123" n="106"/>
kitchen served to bely the apparently cheerless<lb/>
prospect before us. But when that smoking chow-<lb/>
der came in, the mystery was delightfully ex-<lb/>
dlained. Oh, sweet friends! hearken to me. It<lb/>
was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger<lb/>
than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit,<lb/>
and salted pork cut up into little flakes; the whole<lb/>
enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with<lb/>
pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened<lb/>
by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg<lb/>
seeing his favourite fishy food before him, and<lb/>
the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we de-<lb/>
spatched it with great expedition: when leaning<lb/>
back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hus-<lb/>
sey&#x0027;s clam and cod announcement, I thought I<lb/>
would try a little experiment. Stepping to the<lb/>
kitchen door, I uttered the word &#x201C;cod&#x201D; with<lb/>
great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few<lb/>
moments the savoury steam came forth again, but<lb/>
with a different flavour, and in good time a fine<lb/>
cod-chowder was placed before us.</p>
<p>We resumed business; and while plying our<lb/>
spoons in the bowl, thinks I to myself, I wonder<lb/>
now if this has any effect upon the head? What&#x0027;s<lb/>
that stultifying saying about chowder-headed peo-<lb/>
ple? &#x201C;But look, Queequeg, ain&#x0027;t that a live eel<lb/>
in your bowl? Where&#x0027;s your harpoon?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Fishiest of all fishy places was the Twy Pots,<lb/>
which well deserved its name; for the pots there<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n124" n="107"/>
were always boiling chowders. Chowder for break-<lb/>
fast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for<lb/>
supper, till you began to look for fish-bones com-<lb/>
ing through your clothes. The area before the<lb/>
house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey<lb/>
wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebr&#x00E6;; and<lb/>
Hosea Hussey had his account books bound in<lb/>
superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavour<lb/>
to the milk, too, which I could not at all account<lb/>
for, till one morning happening to take a stroll<lb/>
along the beach among some fishermen&#x0027;s boats,<lb/>
I saw Hosea&#x0027;s brindled cow feeding on fish rem-<lb/>
nants, and marching along the sand with each<lb/>
foot in a cod&#x0027;s decapitated head, looking very slip-<lb/>
shod, I assure ye.</p>
<p>Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and di-<lb/>
rections from Mrs. Hussey concerning the nearest<lb/>
way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to pre-<lb/>
cede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her<lb/>
arm, and demanded his harpoon&#x2014;she allowed no<lb/>
harpoon in her chambers. &#x201C;Why not?&#x201D; said I;<lb/>
&#x201C;every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon&#x2014;<lb/>
but why not?&#x201D; &#x201C;Because it&#x0027;s dangerous,&#x201D; says<lb/>
she. &#x201C;Ever since young Stiggs coming from that<lb/>
unfort&#x0027;nt v&#x0027;y&#x0027;ge of his, when he was gone four<lb/>
years and a half, with ony three barrels of <hi rend="i">ile</hi>, was<lb/>
found dead in my first floor back, with his harpoon<lb/>
in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders<lb/>
to take sich dangerous weapons in their rooms<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n125" n="108"/>
a-night. So, Mr. Queequeg&#x201D; (for she had learned<lb/>
his name), &#x201C;I will just take this here iron, and<lb/>
keep it for you till morning. But the chowder;<lb/>
clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Both,&#x201D; says I; &#x201C;and let&#x0027;s have a couple of<lb/>
smoked herrings by way of variety.&#x201D;</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the ship</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">In</hi> bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.<lb/>
But to my surprise and no small concern, Quee-<lb/>
queg now gave me to understand, that he had<lb/>
been diligently consulting Yojo&#x2014;the name of his<lb/>
black little god&#x2014;and Yojo had told him two or<lb/>
three times over, and strongly insisted upon it<lb/>
everyway, that instead of our going together<lb/>
among the whaling-fleet in harbour, and in con-<lb/>
cert selecting our craft&#x2014;instead of this, I say,<lb/>
Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the<lb/>
ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo<lb/>
proposed befriending us; and, in order to do so,<lb/>
had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to<lb/>
myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n126" n="109"/>
for all the world as though it had turned out<lb/>
by chance; and in that vessel I must im-<lb/>
mediately ship myself, for the present irrespective<lb/>
of Queequeg.</p>
<p>I have forgotten to mention that, in many<lb/>
things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the<lb/>
excellence of Yojo&#x0027;s judgment and surprising<lb/>
forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with con-<lb/>
siderable esteem, as a rather good sort of god,<lb/>
who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole,<lb/>
but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent<lb/>
designs.</p>
<p>Now, this plan of Queequeg&#x0027;s, or rather Yojo&#x0027;s,<lb/>
touching the selection of our craft&#x2014;I did not like<lb/>
that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon<lb/>
Queequeg&#x0027;s sagacity to point out the whaler best<lb/>
fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely; but<lb/>
as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon<lb/>
Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accord-<lb/>
ingly prepared to set about this business with a<lb/>
determined, rushing sort of energy and vigour, that<lb/>
should quickly settle that trifling little affair.</p>
<p>Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up<lb/>
with Yojo in our little bedroom&#x2014;for it seemed that<lb/>
it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of<lb/>
fasting, humiliation, and prayer, with Queequeg<lb/>
and Yojo that day&#x2014;<hi rend="i">how</hi> it was I never could find<lb/>
out, for, though I applied myself to it several times,<lb/>
I never could master his religion&#x2014;leaving Quee-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n127" n="110"/>
queg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and<lb/>
Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shav-<lb/>
ings, I sallied out among the shipping. After<lb/>
much prolonged sauntering and many random<lb/>
inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up<lb/>
for three-years&#x0027; voyages: the <hi rend="i">Devil-dam</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Tit-<lb/>
bit</hi>, and the <hi rend="i">Pequod.</hi> Devil-dam, I do not know<lb/>
the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod, you will<lb/>
no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated<lb/>
tribe of Massachusetts Indians, now extinct as the<lb/>
ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Devil-dam</hi>; from her, hopped over to the <hi rend="i">Tit-bit;</hi><lb/>
and, finally, going on board the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>, looked<lb/>
around her for a moment, and then decided that<lb/>
this was the very ship for us.</p>
<p>You may have seen many a quaint craft in your<lb/>
day, for aught I know: square-toed luggers, moun-<lb/>
tainous Japanese junks, butter-box galliots, and<lb/>
what not; but take my word for it, you never<lb/>
saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Pequod.</hi> She was a ship of the old school, rather<lb/>
small, if anything; with an old-fashioned, claw-<lb/>
footed look about her. Long-seasoned and wea-<lb/>
ther-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four<lb/>
oceans, her old hull&#x0027;s complexion was darkened<lb/>
like a French grenadier&#x0027;s, who has alike fought in<lb/>
Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked<lb/>
bearded. Her masts&#x2014;cut somewhere on the coast<lb/>
of Japan, where her original ones were lost over-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n128" n="111"/>
board in a gale&#x2014;her masts stood stiffly up like the<lb/>
spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her<lb/>
ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the<lb/>
pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Ca-<lb/>
thedral, where Becket bled. But to all these her<lb/>
old antiquities, were added new and marvellous<lb/>
features, pertaining to the wild business that, for<lb/>
more than half a century, she had followed. Old<lb/>
Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before<lb/>
he commanded another vessel of his own, and now<lb/>
a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners<lb/>
of the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>,&#x2014;this old Peleg, during the term of<lb/>
his chief-mateship, had built upon her original<lb/>
grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaint-<lb/>
ness, both of material and device, unmatched by<lb/>
anything, except it be Thorkhill-Hake&#x0027;s carved<lb/>
buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any<lb/>
barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with<lb/>
pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of<lb/>
trophies&#x2014;a cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth<lb/>
in the chased bones of her enemies. All round,<lb/>
her unpannelled, open bulwarks, were garnished<lb/>
like one continuous jaw, with the long, sharp teeth<lb/>
of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten<lb/>
her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those<lb/>
thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,<lb/>
but deftly travelled through sheaves of sea-ivory.<lb/>
Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm,<lb/>
she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n129" n="112"/>
one mass, curiously carved from the long, narrow<lb/>
lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman<lb/>
who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like<lb/>
the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by<lb/>
clutching his jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a<lb/>
most melancholy! All noble things are touched<lb/>
with that.</p>
<p>Now, when I looked about the quarter-deck<lb/>
for some one having authority, in order to propose<lb/>
myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw<lb/>
nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange<lb/>
sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little<lb/>
behind the main-mast. It seemed only a tempo-<lb/>
rary erection, used in port. It was of a conical<lb/>
shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long,<lb/>
huge slabs of limber black bone, taken from the<lb/>
middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-<lb/>
whale. Planted with their broad ends on the<lb/>
deck, a circle of these slabs laced together mu-<lb/>
tually sloped towards each other, and at the apex<lb/>
united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy<lb/>
fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some<lb/>
old Pottowottamie Sachem&#x0027;s head. A triangular<lb/>
opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so<lb/>
that the insider commanded a complete view<lb/>
forward.</p>
<p>And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at<lb/>
length found one who, by his aspect, seemed to<lb/>
have authority, and who, it being noon, and the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n130" n="113"/>
ship&#x0027;s work suspended, was now enjoying respite<lb/>
from the burden of command. He was seated on<lb/>
an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over<lb/>
with curious carving, and the bottom of which<lb/>
was formed of a stout interlacing of the same<lb/>
elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed.</p>
<p>There was nothing so very particular, perhaps,<lb/>
about the appearance of the elderly man I saw.<lb/>
He was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,<lb/>
and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in<lb/>
the Quaker style; only there was a fine and<lb/>
almost microscopic net-work of the minutest<lb/>
wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must<lb/>
have arisen from his continual sailings in many<lb/>
hard gales, and always looking to windward;&#x2014;for<lb/>
this causes the muscles about the eyes to become<lb/>
pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very<lb/>
effectual in a scowl.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is this the Captain of the <hi rend="i">Pequod?&#x201D;</hi> said I,<lb/>
advancing to the door of the tent.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Supposing it be the Captain of the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>,<lb/>
what dost thou want of him?&#x201D; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was thinking of shipping.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no<lb/>
Nantucketer&#x2014;ever been in a stove boat?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, sir; I never have.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I<lb/>
dare say&#x2014;eh?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Nothing, sir; but I have no doubt I shall<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n131" n="114"/>
soon learn. I&#x0027;ve been several voyages in the<lb/>
merchant service, and I think that&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Marchant service be d&#x2014;&#x2014;d. Talk not that<lb/>
lingo to me. Dost see that leg?&#x2014;I&#x0027;ll take that<lb/>
leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of<lb/>
the marchant service to me again. Marchant<lb/>
service indeed! I suppose now ye feel consider-<lb/>
able proud of having served in those marchant<lb/>
ships. But, flukes! man, what makes thee want<lb/>
to go a-whaling, eh?&#x2014;it looks a little suspicious,<lb/>
don&#x0027;t it, eh?&#x2014;Hast not been a pirate, hast thou?<lb/>
&#x2014;Didst not rob thy last captain, didst thou?&#x2014;<lb/>
Dost not think of murdering the officers when<lb/>
thou gettest to sea?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I protested my innocence of these things. I saw<lb/>
that, under the mask of these half-humorous inu-<lb/>
endoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish<lb/>
Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices,<lb/>
and rather distrustful of all aliens, unless they<lb/>
hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to<lb/>
know that before I think of shipping ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, sir I want to see what whaling is. I<lb/>
want to see the world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Want to see what whaling is. eh? Have ye<lb/>
clapped eye on Captain Ahab?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who is Captain Ahab, sir?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the<lb/>
captain of this ship.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n132" n="115"/>
<p>&#x201C;I am mistaken, then. I thought I was<lb/>
speaking to the captain himself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg&#x2014;that&#x0027;s<lb/>
who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs<lb/>
to me and Captain Bildad to see the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> fitted<lb/>
out for the voyage, and supplied with all her<lb/>
needs, including crew. We are part owners and<lb/>
agents. But as I was going to say, if thou<lb/>
wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest<lb/>
ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out<lb/>
before ye bind yourself to it past backing out.<lb/>
Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou<lb/>
wilt find that he has only one leg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do you mean, sir? Was the other one<lb/>
lost by a whale?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer<lb/>
to me: it was devoured, chewed up, crunched by<lb/>
the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a<lb/>
boat!&#x2014;ah&#x2014;ah!&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was a little alarmed about his energy, perhaps<lb/>
also a little touched at the hearty grief in his con-<lb/>
cluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could,<lb/>
&#x201C;What you say is no doubt true enough sir; but<lb/>
how could I know there was any peculiar ferocity<lb/>
in that particular whale, though indeed I might<lb/>
have inferred as much from the simple fact of<lb/>
the accident?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look ye now, young man; thy lungs are a<lb/>
sort of soft, d&#x0027;ye see; thou dost not talk shark<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n133" n="116"/>
a bit. <hi rend="i">Sure</hi> ye&#x0027;ve been to sea before now; sure<lb/>
of that?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;I thought I told you that I had<lb/>
been four voyages in the merchant&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hard down out of that! Mind what I said<lb/>
about the marchant service&#x2014;don&#x0027;t aggravate me<lb/>
&#x2014;I won&#x0027;t have it. But let us understand each<lb/>
other. I have given thee a hint about what<lb/>
whaling is: do ye yet feel inclined for it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I do, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch<lb/>
a &#x2018;harpoon down a live whale&#x0027;s throat, and then<lb/>
jump after it? Answer, quick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am, sir, if it should be positively indispens-<lb/>
able to do so: not to be got rid of, that is; which<lb/>
I don&#x0027;t take to be the fact.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good again. Now then, thou not only want-<lb/>
est to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what<lb/>
whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see<lb/>
the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought<lb/>
so. Well then, just step forward there, and take<lb/>
a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me<lb/>
and tell me what ye see there.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this<lb/>
curious request, not knowing exactly how to take<lb/>
it, whether humorously or in earnest. But con-<lb/>
centrating all his crow&#x0027;s feet into one scowl, Cap-<lb/>
tain Peleg started me on the errand.</p>
<p>Going forward and glancing over the weather bow,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n134" n="117"/>
I perceived that the ship, swinging to her anchor<lb/>
with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing<lb/>
towards the open ocean. The prospect was un-<lb/>
limited, but exceedingly monotonous and forbid-<lb/>
ding&#x2014;not the slightest variety that I could see.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, what&#x0027;s the report?&#x201D; said Peleg, when<lb/>
I came back; &#x201C;what did ye see?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Not much,&#x201D; I replied&#x2014;&#x201C;nothing but water:<lb/>
considerable horizon though, and there&#x0027;s a squall<lb/>
coming up, I think.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, what dost thou think, then, of seeing<lb/>
the world? Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn<lb/>
to see any more of it, eh? Can&#x0027;t ye see the world<lb/>
where you stand?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was a little staggered; but go a-whaling I<lb/>
must, and I would; and the Pequod was as good<lb/>
a ship as any&#x2014;I thought the best&#x2014;and all this<lb/>
I now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so deter-<lb/>
mined he expressed his willingness to ship me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And thou mayest as well sign the papers<lb/>
right off,&#x201D; he added&#x2014;&#x201C;come along with ye.&#x201D;<lb/>
And so saying. he led the way below deck into<lb/>
the cabin.</p>
<p>Seated on the transom was what seemed to<lb/>
me a most uncommon and surprising figure. It<lb/>
turned out to be Captain Bildad, who, along with<lb/>
Captain Peleg, was one of the largest owners of<lb/>
the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the<lb/>
case in these ports, being held by a crowd of old<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n135" n="118"/>
annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chan-<lb/>
cery wards; each owning about the value of a<lb/>
timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail or two<lb/>
in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their<lb/>
money in whaling vessels, the same way that you<lb/>
do yours in approved state stocks, bringing in<lb/>
good interest.</p>
<p>Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many<lb/>
other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the island<lb/>
having been originally settled by that sect;<lb/>
and to this day its inhabitants in general retain<lb/>
in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the<lb/>
Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified<lb/>
by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.<lb/>
For some of these same Quakers are the most<lb/>
sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They<lb/>
are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a<lb/>
vengeance.</p>
<p>So that there are instances among them of men,<lb/>
who, named with Scripture names&#x2014;a singularly<lb/>
common fashion on the island&#x2014;and in childhood<lb/>
naturally imbibing the stately dramatic <hi rend="i">thee</hi> and<lb/>
<hi rend="i">thou</hi> of the Quaker idiom&#x2014;still, from the auda-<lb/>
cious, daring, and boundless adventure of their<lb/>
subsequent lives, strangely blend with these un-<lb/>
outgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of<lb/>
character, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king,<lb/>
or a poetical pagan Roman. And when these<lb/>
things unite in a man of greatly superior natural<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n136" n="119"/>
force, with a globular brain and a ponderous heart;<lb/>
who has also by the stillness and seclusion of<lb/>
many long night-watches in the remotest waters,<lb/>
and beneath constellations never seen here at the<lb/>
north, been led to think untraditionally and inde-<lb/>
pendently; receiving all nature&#x0027;s sweet or savage<lb/>
impressions fresh from her own virgin, voluntary,<lb/>
and confiding breast; and thereby chiefly, but<lb/>
with some help from accidental advantages, to<lb/>
learn a bold and nervous, lofty language&#x2014;that<lb/>
man makes one in a whole nation&#x0027;s census&#x2014;a<lb/>
mighty pageant creature, formed for noble trage-<lb/>
dies. Nor will it at all detract from him, drama-<lb/>
tically regarded, if either by birth, or other cir-<lb/>
cumstances, he has what seems a half wilful<lb/>
over-ruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature.<lb/>
For all men, tragically great, are made so through<lb/>
a certain morbidness. Be sure of this, O young<lb/>
ambition; all mortal greatness is but disease. But,<lb/>
as yet we have not to do with such an one, but<lb/>
with quite another; and still a man, who, if in-<lb/>
deed peculiar, it only results again from another<lb/>
phase of the Quaker, modified by individual cir-<lb/>
cumstances.</p>
<p>Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-<lb/>
to-do, retired whaleman. But unlike Captain<lb/>
Peleg&#x2014;who cared not a rush for what are called<lb/>
serious things and, indeed, deemed those self-<lb/>
same serious things the veriest of all trifles&#x2014;Cap-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n137" n="120"/>
tain Bildad had not only been originally educated<lb/>
according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Qua-<lb/>
kerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the<lb/>
sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures<lb/>
round the Horn&#x2014;all that had not moved this<lb/>
native born Quaker one single jot, had not so<lb/>
much as altered one angle of his vest. Still, for<lb/>
all this immutableness, was there some lack of<lb/>
common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad.<lb/>
Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to<lb/>
bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had<lb/>
illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and<lb/>
though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet had he<lb/>
in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns<lb/>
of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative<lb/>
evening of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled<lb/>
these things in the reminiscence, I do not know;<lb/>
but it did not seem to concern him much, and<lb/>
very probably he had long since come to the sage<lb/>
and sensible conclusion that a man&#x0027;s religion is<lb/>
one thing, and this practical world quite another.<lb/>
This world pays dividends. Rising from a little<lb/>
cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab,<lb/>
to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat;<lb/>
from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and<lb/>
captain, and finally a ship-owner, Bildad, as I<lb/>
hinted before, had concluded his adventurous<lb/>
career by wholly retiring from active life at the<lb/>
goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n138" n="121"/>
days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned<lb/>
income.</p>
<p>Now Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the repu-<lb/>
tation of being an incorrigible old hunks, and in<lb/>
his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master.<lb/>
They told me in Nantucket&#x2014;though it certainly<lb/>
seems a curious story&#x2014;that when he sailed the<lb/>
old Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving<lb/>
home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hos-<lb/>
pital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious<lb/>
man, especially for a Quaker, he was certainly<lb/>
rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never<lb/>
used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but<lb/>
somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel,<lb/>
unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad<lb/>
was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye<lb/>
intently looking at you, made you feel completely<lb/>
nervous, till you could clutch something&#x2014;a hammer<lb/>
or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad at<lb/>
something or other&#x2014;never mind what. Indolence<lb/>
and idleness perished from before him. His own<lb/>
person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian<lb/>
character. On his long, gaunt body he carried<lb/>
no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin<lb/>
having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn<lb/>
nap of his broad-brimmed hat.</p>
<p>Such, then, was the person that I saw seated<lb/>
on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg<lb/>
down into the cabin. The space between the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n139" n="122"/>
decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old<lb/>
Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and<lb/>
this to save his coat-tails. His broad-brim was<lb/>
placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed;<lb/>
his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin;<lb/>
and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in<lb/>
reading from a ponderous volume.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bildad,&#x201D; cried Captain Peleg; &#x201C;at it again,<lb/>
Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scrip-<lb/>
tures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain<lb/>
knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?&#x201D;</p>
<p>As if long habituated to such profane talk from<lb/>
his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his pre-<lb/>
sent irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me,<lb/>
glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He says he&#x0027;s our man, Bildad,&#x201D; said Peleg;<lb/>
&#x201C;he wants to ship.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Dost thee?&#x201D; said Bildad, in a hollow tone,<lb/>
and turning round to me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I <hi rend="i">dost</hi>,&#x201D; said I, unconsciously&#x2014;he was so in-<lb/>
tense a Quaker.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do ye think of him, Bildad?&#x201D; said<lb/>
Peleg.</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;ll do,&#x201D; said Bildad, eyeing me, and then<lb/>
went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling<lb/>
tone, quite audible.</p>
<p>I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever<lb/>
saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old ship-<lb/>
mate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n140" n="123"/>
only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw<lb/>
open a chest, and drawing forth the ship&#x0027;s arti-<lb/>
cles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated<lb/>
himself at a little table. I began to think it was<lb/>
high time to settle with myself at what terms I<lb/>
would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was<lb/>
already aware that in the whaling business they<lb/>
paid no wages; but all hands, including the cap-<lb/>
tain, received certain shares of the profits, called<lb/>
<hi rend="i">lays</hi>, and that these lays were proportioned to the<lb/>
degree of importance pertaining to the respective<lb/>
duties of the ship&#x0027;s company. I was also aware<lb/>
that, being a green hand at whaling, my own lay<lb/>
would not be very large; but considering that I<lb/>
was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice<lb/>
a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that, from<lb/>
all I had heard, I should be offered at least the<lb/>
275th lay&#x2014;that is, the 275th part of the clear net<lb/>
proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might even-<lb/>
tually amount to. And though the 275th lay was<lb/>
what they call a rather <hi rend="i">long lay</hi>, yet it was better<lb/>
than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage,<lb/>
might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would<lb/>
wear out on it, not to speak of my three years&#x0027;<lb/>
beef and board, for which I would not have to<lb/>
pay one stiver.</p>
<p>It might be thought that this was a poor way<lb/>
to accumulate a princely fortune&#x2014;and so it was,<lb/>
a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n141" n="124"/>
that never take on about princely fortunes, and<lb/>
am quite content if the world is ready to board<lb/>
and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim<lb/>
sign of the Thunder-Cloud. Upon the whole, I<lb/>
thought that the 275th lay would be about the<lb/>
fair thing, but would not have been surprised had<lb/>
I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a<lb/>
broad-shouldered make.</p>
<p>But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a<lb/>
little distrustful about receiving a generous share<lb/>
of the profits was this: ashore, I had heard some-<lb/>
thing of both Captain Peleg and his unaccount-<lb/>
able old crony, Bildad; how that they, being the<lb/>
principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore<lb/>
the other and more inconsiderable and scattered<lb/>
owners, left nearly the whole management of the<lb/>
ship&#x0027;s affairs to these two. And I did not know<lb/>
but that the stingy old Bildad might have a deal<lb/>
to say about shipping hands, especially as I now<lb/>
found him on board the Pequod, quite at home<lb/>
there in the cabin, and reading his Bible, as if at<lb/>
his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly<lb/>
trying to mend a pen with his jack-knife, old<lb/>
Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that<lb/>
he was such an interested party in these proceed-<lb/>
ings&#x2014;Bildad never heeded us, but went on mum-<lb/>
bling to himself out of his book, &#x201D;<hi rend="i">Lay</hi> not up for<lb/>
yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, Captain Bildad,&#x201D; interrupted Peleg,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n142" n="125"/>
&#x201C;what d&#x0027;ye say,&#x2014;what lay shall we give this young<lb/>
man?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou knowest best,&#x201D; was the sepulchral<lb/>
reply; &#x201C;the seven hundred and seventy-seventh<lb/>
wouldn&#x0027;t be too much, would it?&#x2014;&#x2018;where moth<lb/>
and rust do corrupt, but <hi rend="i">lay</hi>&#x2014;&#x0027;&#x201D;</p>
<p><hi rend="i">Lay</hi>, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the<lb/>
seven hundred and seventy-seventh! Well, old<lb/>
Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall<lb/>
not <hi rend="i">lay</hi> up many <hi rend="i">lays</hi> here below, where moth and<lb/>
rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly <hi rend="i">long lay</hi><lb/>
that, indeed; and though from the magnitude of<lb/>
the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet<lb/>
the slightest consideration will show that though<lb/>
seven hundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large<lb/>
number, yet, when you come to make a <hi rend="i">teenth</hi> of<lb/>
it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred<lb/>
and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good<lb/>
deal less than seven hundred and seventy-seven<lb/>
gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, b&#x2014;t your eyes, Bildad,&#x201D; cried Peleg,<lb/>
&#x201C;thou dost not want to swindle this young man!<lb/>
he must have more than that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,&#x201D; again<lb/>
said Bildad, without lifting his eyes; and then<lb/>
went on mumbling&#x2014;&#x201C;for where your treasure is,<lb/>
there will your heart be also.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am going to put him down for the three<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n143" n="126"/>
hundredth,&#x201D; said Peleg; &#x201C;do ye hear that Bildad?<lb/>
The three hundredth lay, I say.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly<lb/>
towards him, said: &#x201C;Captain Peleg, thou hast a<lb/>
generous heart; but thou must consider the duty<lb/>
thou owest to the other owners of this ship&#x2014;<lb/>
widows and orphans, many of them&#x2014;and that if<lb/>
we too abundantly reward the labours of this<lb/>
young man, we may be taking the bread from<lb/>
those widows and those orphans. The seven hun-<lb/>
dred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou Bildad!&#x201D; roared Peleg, starting up, and<lb/>
clattering about the cabin. &#x201C;B&#x2014;t ye, Captain<lb/>
Bildad; if I had followed thy advice in these mat-<lb/>
ters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug<lb/>
about, that would be heavy enough to founder the<lb/>
largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Peleg,&#x201D; said Bildad steadily, &#x201C;thy<lb/>
conscience may be drawing ten inches of water, or<lb/>
ten fathoms&#x2014;I can&#x0027;t tell; but as thou art still an<lb/>
impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest<lb/>
thy conscience be but a leaky one, and will in the<lb/>
end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit,<lb/>
Captain Peleg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man: past<lb/>
all natural bearing, ye insult me. It&#x0027;s an all-fired<lb/>
outrage to tell any human creature that he&#x0027;s<lb/>
bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n144" n="127"/>
that again to me, and start my soul-boults, but<lb/>
I&#x0027;ll&#x2014;I&#x0027;ll&#x2014;yes, I&#x0027;ll swallow a live goat with all his<lb/>
hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,<lb/>
drab-coloured son of a wooden gun&#x2014;a straight<lb/>
wake with ye!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As he thundered out this, he made a rush at<lb/>
Bildad; but with a marvellous oblique, sliding<lb/>
celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.</p>
<p>Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the<lb/>
two principal and responsible owners of the ship,<lb/>
and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sail-<lb/>
ing in a vessel so questionably owned and tempo-<lb/>
rarily commanded, I stepped aside from the door<lb/>
to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt,<lb/>
was all eagerness to vanish from before the<lb/>
awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonish-<lb/>
ment, he sat down again on the transom very<lb/>
quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest in-<lb/>
tention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to<lb/>
impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg,<lb/>
after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed<lb/>
no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like<lb/>
a lamb, though he twitched a little, as if still ner-<lb/>
vously agitated. &#x201C;Whew!&#x201D; he whistled at last&#x2014;<lb/>
&#x201C;the squall&#x0027;s gone off to leeward, I think. Bil-<lb/>
dad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance,<lb/>
mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs<lb/>
the grindstone. That&#x0027;s he; thank ye, Bildad.<lb/>
Now then, my young man: Ishmael&#x0027;s thy name,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n145" n="128"/>
didn&#x0027;t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ish-<lb/>
mael, for the three hundredth lay.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Peleg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;I have a friend with<lb/>
me who wants a ship too&#x2014;shall I bring him down<lb/>
to-morrow?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;To be sure,&#x201D; said Peleg. &#x201C;Fetch him along,<lb/>
and we&#x0027;ll look at him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What lay does <hi rend="i">he</hi> want?&#x201D; groaned Bildad,<lb/>
glancing up from the book in which he had again<lb/>
been burying himself.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,&#x201D;<lb/>
said Peleg. &#x201C;Has he ever whaled it any?&#x201D; tur-<lb/>
ning to me.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Killed more whales than I can count, Captain<lb/>
Peleg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well, bring him along then.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And, after signing the papers, off I went;<lb/>
nothing doubting but that I had done a good<lb/>
morning&#x0027;s work, and that the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> was the<lb/>
identical ship that Yojo had provided to carry<lb/>
Queequeg and me round the Cape.</p>
<p>But I had not proceeded far, when I began to<lb/>
bethink me that the captain with whom I was to<lb/>
sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed,<lb/>
in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely<lb/>
fitted out, and receive all her crew on board, ere<lb/>
the captain makes himself visible by arriving to<lb/>
take command. For sometimes these voyages are<lb/>
so prolonged, and the short intervals at home so<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n146" n="129"/>
exceedingly brief, that if the captain has a family, or<lb/>
any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does<lb/>
not trouble himself much about his ship in port,<lb/>
but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for<lb/>
sea. However, it is always as well to have a look<lb/>
at him before irrevocably committing yourself into<lb/>
his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain<lb/>
Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be<lb/>
found.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?<lb/>
It&#x0027;s all right enough: thou art shipped.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes, but I should like to see him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;But I don&#x0027;t think thou wilt be able to at pre-<lb/>
sent. I don&#x0027;t know exactly what&#x0027;s the matter<lb/>
with him; but he keeps close inside the house&#x2014;<lb/>
a sort of sick, and yet he don&#x0027;t look so. In fact,<lb/>
he ain&#x0027;t sick; but no, he isn&#x0027;t well either. Any<lb/>
how, young man, he won&#x0027;t always see me, so I<lb/>
don&#x0027;t suppose he will thee. He&#x0027;s a queer man,<lb/>
Captain Ahab&#x2014;so some think&#x2014;but a good one.<lb/>
Oh, thou&#x0027;lt like him well enough: no fear, no fear.<lb/>
He&#x0027;s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain<lb/>
Ahab; doesn&#x0027;t speak much; but when he does<lb/>
speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye; be<lb/>
forewarned. Ahab&#x0027;s above the common; Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
been in colleges, as well as &#x0027;mong the cannibals;<lb/>
been used to deeper wonders than the waves;<lb/>
fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than<lb/>
whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n147" n="130"/>
surest that, out of all our isle! Oh! he ain&#x0027;t<lb/>
Captain Bildad: no, and he ain&#x0027;t Captain Peleg:<lb/>
<hi rend="i">he&#x0027;s Ahab</hi>, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,<lb/>
was a crowned king!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And a very vile one. When that wicked king<lb/>
was slain, the dogs&#x2014;did they not lick his blood?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come hither to me&#x2014;hither, hither,&#x201D; said<lb/>
Peleg, with a significance in his eye that almost<lb/>
startled me. &#x201C;Look ye, lad; never say that on<lb/>
board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Cap-<lb/>
tain Ahab did not name himself. &#x0027;Twas a foolish,<lb/>
ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who<lb/>
died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And<lb/>
yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the<lb/>
name would somehow prove prophetic. And, per-<lb/>
haps, other fools like her may tell thee the same.<lb/>
I wish to warn thee. It&#x0027;s a lie. I know Captain<lb/>
Ahab well: I&#x0027;ve sailed with him as mate years<lb/>
ago: I know what he is&#x2014;a good man;&#x2014;not a pious,<lb/>
good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man<lb/>
&#x2014;something like me&#x2014;only there&#x0027;s a good deal<lb/>
more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never<lb/>
very jolly; and I know that on the passage home,<lb/>
he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it<lb/>
was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding<lb/>
stump that brought that about, as any one might<lb/>
see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg<lb/>
last voyage by that accursed whale, he&#x0027;s been a<lb/>
kind of moody&#x2014;desperate moody, and savage<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n148" n="131"/>
sometimes; but that will all pass off. And once<lb/>
for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young<lb/>
man;&#x2014;it&#x0027;s better to sail with a moody good cap-<lb/>
tain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to<lb/>
thee&#x2014;and wrong not Captain Ahah, because he<lb/>
happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my<lb/>
boy, he has a wife&#x2014;not three voyages wedded&#x2014;a<lb/>
sweet, resigned girl. Think of that: by that<lb/>
sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then<lb/>
there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab?<lb/>
No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab<lb/>
has his humanities!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness.<lb/>
What had been incidentally revealed to me of<lb/>
Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vague-<lb/>
ness of painfulness concerning him. And some-<lb/>
how, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow<lb/>
for him, but for I don&#x0027;t know what, unless it was<lb/>
the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a<lb/>
strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I<lb/>
cannot at all describe, was not exactly awe&#x2014;I do<lb/>
not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did<lb/>
not disincline me towards him; though I felt im-<lb/>
patience at what seemed like mystery in him, so<lb/>
imperfectly as he was known to me then. How-<lb/>
ever, my thoughts were at length carried in other<lb/>
directions, so that for the present dark Ahab<lb/>
slipped my mind.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the ramadan</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">As</hi> Queequeg&#x0027;s Ramadan was to continue all day,<lb/>
I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-<lb/>
fall; for I cherish the greatest respect towards<lb/>
everybody&#x0027;s religious obligations, never mind how<lb/>
comical, and could not find it in my heart to<lb/>
undervalue even a congregation of ants worship-<lb/>
ping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in<lb/>
certain parts of our earth, who, with a degree of<lb/>
footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,<lb/>
bow down before the torso of a deceased landed<lb/>
proprietor merely on account of the inordinate<lb/>
possessions yet owned and rented in his name.</p>
<p>I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should<lb/>
be charitable in these things, and not fancy our-<lb/>
selves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans<lb/>
and what not, because of their half crazy conceits<lb/>
on these subjects. There was Queequeg, now,<lb/>
certainly entertaining the most absurd notions<lb/>
about Yojo and his Ramadan; but what of that?<lb/>
Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I<lb/>
suppose: he seemed to be content&#x2014;and there let<lb/>
him rest. All our arguing with him would not<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n150" n="133"/>
avail: let him be, I say; and Heaven have mercy<lb/>
on us all&#x2014;Presbyterians and Pagans alike&#x2014;for we<lb/>
are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head,<lb/>
and sadly need mending.</p>
<p>Towards evening, when I felt assured that all<lb/>
his performances and rituals must be over, I went<lb/>
up to his room and knocked at the door&#x2014;but<lb/>
no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened<lb/>
inside. &#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, softly through the<lb/>
key-hole: all silent. &#x201C;I say, Queequeg! why<lb/>
don&#x0027;t you speak? It&#x0027;s I&#x2014;Ishmael.&#x201D; But all<lb/>
remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed.<lb/>
I had allowed him such abundant time, I thought<lb/>
he might have had an apopletic fit. I looked<lb/>
through the key-hole; but the door opening into<lb/>
an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect<lb/>
was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only<lb/>
see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of<lb/>
the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to<lb/>
behold, resting against the wall, the wooden shaft<lb/>
of Queequeg&#x0027;s harpoon, which the landlady the<lb/>
evening previous had taken from him, before our<lb/>
mounting to the chamber. That&#x0027;s strange, thought<lb/>
I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands<lb/>
yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad<lb/>
without it, therefore, he must be inside here, and<lb/>
no possible mistake.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg! Queequeg!&#x201D;&#x2014;all still. Some-<lb/>
thing must have happened. Apoplexy! I tried<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n151" n="134"/>
to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.<lb/>
Running down stairs, I quickly stated my sus-<lb/>
picions to the first person I met&#x2014;the chamber-<lb/>
maid. &#x201C;La! La!&#x201D; she cried, &#x201C;I thought<lb/>
something must be the matter. I went to make<lb/>
the bed after breakfast, and the door was locked,<lb/>
and not a mouse to be heard; and it&#x0027;s been just<lb/>
so silent ever since. But I thought, may be, you<lb/>
had both gone off and locked your baggage in<lb/>
for safe keeping. La! La, ma&#x0027;am&#x2014;mistress!<lb/>
murder! Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!&#x201D; and with<lb/>
these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I fol-<lb/>
lowing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-<lb/>
pot in one hand and a vinegar-cruet in the other,<lb/>
having just broken away from the occupation<lb/>
of attending to the castors, and scolding her little<lb/>
black boy meantime.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Woodhouse!&#x201D; cried I &#x201C;which way to it?<lb/>
Run, for God&#x0027;s sake, and fetch something to pry<lb/>
open the door&#x2014;the axe!&#x2014;the axe!&#x2014;he&#x0027;s had a<lb/>
stroke; depend upon it!&#x201D; and so saying, I was<lb/>
unmethodically rushing up-stairs again empty-<lb/>
handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mus-<lb/>
tard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor<lb/>
of her countenance.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s the matter with you, young man?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Get the axe! For God&#x0027;s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it open!&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n152" n="135"/>
<p>&#x201C;Look here,&#x201D; said the landlady, quickly putting<lb/>
down the vinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand<lb/>
free; &#x201C;look here; are you talking about prying<lb/>
open any of my doors?&#x201D; and with that she seized<lb/>
my arm. &#x201C;What&#x0027;s the matter with you? What&#x0027;s<lb/>
the matter with you, shipmate?&#x201D;</p>
<p>In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible,<lb/>
I gave her to understand the whole case. Un-<lb/>
consciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side<lb/>
of her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then<lb/>
exclaimed&#x2014;&#x201C;No! I haven&#x0027;t seen it since I put it<lb/>
there.&#x201D; Running to a little closet under the<lb/>
landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning<lb/>
told me that Queequeg&#x0027;s harpoon was missing.<lb/>
&#x201C;He&#x0027;s killed himself, she cried. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s unfort&#x0027;nate<lb/>
Stiggs done over again&#x2014;there goes another coun-<lb/>
terpane&#x2014;God pity his poor mother!&#x2014;it will be<lb/>
the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad a sister?<lb/>
Where&#x0027;s that girl? there, Betty, go to Snarles<lb/>
the painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with<lb/>
&#x2014;&#x2018;no suicides permitted here, and no smoking in<lb/>
the parlour;&#x2019;&#x2014;might as well kill both birds at<lb/>
once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost!<lb/>
What&#x0027;s that noise there? You, young man, avast<lb/>
there!&#x201D;</p>
<p>And running up after me, she caught me, as<lb/>
I was again trying to force open the door.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I won&#x0027;t allow it; I won&#x0027;t have my premises<lb/>
spoiled. Go for the locksmith; there&#x0027;s one about<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n153" n="136"/>
a mile from here. But avast!&#x201D; putting her hand<lb/>
in her side pocket, &#x201C;here&#x0027;s a key that&#x0027;ll fit, I<lb/>
guess; let&#x0027;s see.&#x201D; And with that, she turned<lb/>
it in the lock; but alas! Queequeg&#x0027;s supple-<lb/>
mental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Have to burst it open,&#x201D; said I, and was<lb/>
running down the entry a little, for a good start,<lb/>
when the landlady caught at me, again vowing<lb/>
I should not break down her premises; but I tore<lb/>
from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed<lb/>
myself full against the mark.</p>
<p>With a prodigious noise the door flew open,<lb/>
and the knob slamming against the wall, sent the<lb/>
plaster to the ceiling; and there&#x2014;good heavens!<lb/>
there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-<lb/>
collected; right in the middle of the room; squat-<lb/>
ting on his hams, and holding Yojo on the top of<lb/>
his head. He looked neither one way nor the<lb/>
other way, but sat like a carved image with scarce<lb/>
a sign of active life.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, going up to him; &#x201C;Quee-<lb/>
queg, what&#x0027;s the matter with you?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He hain&#x0027;t been a sittin&#x2019; so all day, has he?&#x201D;<lb/>
said the landlady.</p>
<p>But all we said&#x2014;not a word could we drag out<lb/>
of him. I almost felt like pushing him over, so<lb/>
as to change his position, for it was almost in-<lb/>
tolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally<lb/>
constrained; especially as in all probability he<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n154" n="137"/>
had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten<lb/>
hours, going too without his regular meals.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mrs. Hussey,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;he&#x0027;s <hi rend="i">alive</hi> at all<lb/>
events; so leave us, if you please, and I will see<lb/>
to this strange affair myself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Closing the door upon the landlady, I en-<lb/>
deavoured to prevail upon Queequeg to take a<lb/>
chair, but in vain. There he sat; and all I could<lb/>
do&#x2014;for all my polite arts and blandishments&#x2014;he<lb/>
would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor<lb/>
even look at me, nor notice my presence in any,<lb/>
the slightest way.</p>
<p>I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a<lb/>
part of his Ramadan. Do they fast on their<lb/>
hams that way in his native island? It must be<lb/>
so: yes, it&#x0027;s part of his creed, I suppose. Well,<lb/>
then, let him rest: he&#x0027;ll get up sooner or later,<lb/>
no doubt. It can&#x0027;t last for ever, thank God, and<lb/>
his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don&#x0027;t<lb/>
believe its very punctual then.</p>
<p>I went down to supper. After sitting a long<lb/>
time listening to the long stories of some sailors<lb/>
who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,<lb/>
as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage<lb/>
in a schooner or brig, confined to the north of<lb/>
the Line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after<lb/>
listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly<lb/>
eleven o&#x0027;clock, I went up stairs to go to bed,<lb/>
feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n155" n="138"/>
certainly have brought his Ramadan to a ter-<lb/>
mination. But no; there he was just where I had<lb/>
left him&#x2014;he had not stirred an inch. I began to<lb/>
grow vexed with him: it seemed so downright<lb/>
senseless and insane to be sitting there all day<lb/>
and half the night on his hams in a cold room,<lb/>
holding a piece of wood on his head.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For heaven&#x0027;s sake, Queequeg, get up and<lb/>
shake yourself! get up and have some supper.<lb/>
You&#x0027;ll starve; you&#x0027;ll kill yourself, Queequeg,&#x201D;<lb/>
But not a word did he reply.</p>
<p>Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to<lb/>
go to bed and to sleep; and no doubt, before a<lb/>
great while, he would follow me. But previous<lb/>
to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket,<lb/>
and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very<lb/>
cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary<lb/>
round jacket on. For some time, do all I would,<lb/>
I could not get into the faintest doze. I had<lb/>
blown out the candle; and the mere thought of<lb/>
Queequeg&#x2014;not four feet off&#x2014;sitting there in that<lb/>
uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark<lb/>
&#x2014;this made me really wretched. Think of it!<lb/>
sleeping all night in the same room with a wide<lb/>
awake pagan on his hams, in this dreary, un-<lb/>
accountable Ramadan!</p>
<p>But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew<lb/>
nothing more till break of day; when, looking<lb/>
over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n156" n="139"/>
he had been screwed down to the floor. But as<lb/>
soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the win-<lb/>
dow, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but<lb/>
with a cheerful look; limped towards me where<lb/>
I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine;<lb/>
and said his Ramadan was over.</p>
<p>Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to<lb/>
any person&#x0027;s religion, be it what it may, so long<lb/>
as that person does not kill or insult any other<lb/>
person, because that other person don&#x0027;t believe it<lb/>
also. But when a man&#x0027;s religion becomes really<lb/>
frantic; when it is a positive torment to him;<lb/>
and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncom-<lb/>
fortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high<lb/>
time to take that individual aside and argue the<lb/>
point with him.</p>
<p>And just so I now did with Quee-<lb/>
queg. &#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;get into bed now, and lie and<lb/>
listen to me.&#x201D; I then went on, beginning with<lb/>
the rise and progress of the primitive religions,<lb/>
and coming down to the various religions of the<lb/>
present time, during which time I laboured to<lb/>
show Queequeg that all fasts, voluntary or other-<lb/>
wise, were excessively bad for the digestion.</p>
<p>I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was<lb/>
ever troubled with dyspepsia; expressing the idea<lb/>
very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said<lb/>
no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was<lb/>
after a great feast given by his father the king, on<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n157" n="140"/>
the gaining of a great battle, wherein fifty of the<lb/>
enemy had been killed by about two o&#x0027;clock in the<lb/>
afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very<lb/>
evening.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No more, Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, shuddering;<lb/>
&#x201C;that will do;&#x201D; for I knew the inferences without<lb/>
his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who<lb/>
had visited that very island, and he told me that<lb/>
it was the custom, when a great battle had been<lb/>
gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard<lb/>
or garden of the victor; and then, one by one,<lb/>
they were placed in great wooden trenchers, and<lb/>
garnished round like a pilau, with bread-fruit and<lb/>
cocoa-nuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,<lb/>
were sent round with the victor&#x0027;s compliments to<lb/>
all his friends, just as though these presents were<lb/>
so many Christmas turkeys.</p>
<p>After all, I do not think that my remarks about<lb/>
religion made much impression upon Queequeg.<lb/>
Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed<lb/>
dull of hearing on that important subject, unless<lb/>
considered from his own point of view; and, in<lb/>
the second place, he did not more than one-third<lb/>
understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would;<lb/>
and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good<lb/>
deal more about the true religion than I did. He<lb/>
looked at me with a sort of condescending con-<lb/>
cern and compassion, as though he thought it a<lb/>
great pity that such a sensible young man<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n158" n="141"/>
should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan<lb/>
piety.</p>
<p>At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg,<lb/>
taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders<lb/>
of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make<lb/>
much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied<lb/>
out to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and<lb/>
picking our teeth with halibut bones.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d18" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XVIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">his mark</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">As</hi> we were walking down the end of the wharf<lb/>
towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon,<lb/>
Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us<lb/>
from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my<lb/>
friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announ-<lb/>
cing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,<lb/>
unless they previously produced their papers.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?&#x201D;<lb/>
said I, now jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving<lb/>
may comrade standing on the wharf.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I mean,&#x201D; he replied, &#x201C;he must show his<lb/>
papers.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n159" n="142"/>
<p>&#x201C;Yea,&#x201D; said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice,<lb/>
sticking his head from behind Peleg&#x0027;s, out of the<lb/>
wigwam. &#x201C;He must show that he&#x0027;s converted.<lb/>
Son of darkness,&#x201D; he added, turning to Queequeg,<lb/>
&#x201C;art thou at present in communion with any<lb/>
christian church?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;he&#x0027;s a member of the First<lb/>
Congregational Church,&#x201D; and I entered upon a<lb/>
long rigmarole story, touching the conversion of<lb/>
Queequeg, and concluded by saying that in the<lb/>
grand belief we all joined hands.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Splice, thou mean&#x0027;st <hi rend="i">splice</hi> hands,&#x201D; cried<lb/>
Peleg, drawing nearer. &#x201C;Young man, you&#x0027;d<lb/>
better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast<lb/>
hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon<lb/>
Deuteronomy &#x2014; why, Father Mapple himself<lb/>
couldn&#x0027;t beat it, and he&#x0027;s reckoned something.<lb/>
Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about<lb/>
the papers. I say, tell Quohog there&#x2014;what&#x0027;s<lb/>
that you call him?&#x2014;tell Quohog to step along.<lb/>
By the great anchor, what a harpoon he&#x0027;s got<lb/>
there! looks like good stuff that; and he handles<lb/>
it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your<lb/>
name is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-<lb/>
boat? did you ever strike a fish?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild<lb/>
sort of way, jumped upon the bulwarks, from<lb/>
thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats<lb/>
hanging to the side; and then bracing his left<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n160" n="143"/>
knee, and poising the harpoon, cried out in some<lb/>
such way as this:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cap&#x0027;ain, you see him small drop tar on water<lb/>
dere? You see him? well, spose him one whale<lb/>
eye; well, den!&#x201D; and taking sharp aim at it, he<lb/>
darted the iron right over old Bildad&#x0027;s broad brim,<lb/>
clean across the ship&#x0027;s decks, and struck the glis-<lb/>
tening tar spot out of sight.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now,&#x201D; said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the<lb/>
line, &#x201C;spos-ee him whale-e eye; why, dad whale<lb/>
dead.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Quick, Bildad,&#x201D; said Peleg, his partner, who,<lb/>
aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon,<lb/>
had retreated towards the cabin gangway. &#x201C;Quick,<lb/>
I say, you Bildad, and get the ship&#x0027;s papers.<lb/>
We must have Hedgehog there&#x2014;I mean Quohog<lb/>
&#x2014;in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog: we&#x0027;ll<lb/>
give ye the ninetieth lay, and that&#x0027;s more than<lb/>
ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So down we went into the cabin, and to my<lb/>
great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the<lb/>
same ship&#x0027;s company to which I myself<lb/>
belonged.</p>
<p>When all preliminaries were over, and Peleg<lb/>
had got everything ready for signing, he turned<lb/>
to me and said, &#x201C;I guess Quohog there don&#x0027;t<lb/>
know how to write, does he? I say, Quohog,<lb/>
b&#x2014;t ye! dost thou sign thy name, or make thy<lb/>
mark?&#x201D;</p>
<p>But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n161" n="144"/>
or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies,<lb/>
looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered<lb/>
pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place,<lb/>
an exact counterpart of a queer round figure<lb/>
which was tattooed upon his arm; so that, through<lb/>
Captain Peleg&#x0027;s obstinate mistake touching his<lb/>
appellative, it stood something like this:&#x2014;</p>
<quote>
<p>Quohog,<lb/>
his &#x2720; mark.</p>
</quote>
<p>Meanwhile, Captain Bildad sat earnestly and<lb/>
steadfastly eyeing Queequeg, and at last rising<lb/>
solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his<lb/>
broad-skirted drab-coat, took out a bundle of<lb/>
tracts, and selecting one entitled, &#x201C;The Latter<lb/>
Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,&#x201D; placed it in<lb/>
Queequeg&#x0027;s hands, and then grasping them and<lb/>
the book with both his, looked earnestly into his<lb/>
eyes, and said, &#x201C;Son of darkness, I must do my<lb/>
duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and<lb/>
feel concerned for the souls of all its crew: if thou<lb/>
still clingest to thy pagan ways, which I sadly<lb/>
fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial<lb/>
bondsman. Spurn the idol Bel, and the hideous<lb/>
dragon; turn from the wrath to come; mind thine<lb/>
eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear of<lb/>
the fiery pit!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old<lb/>
Bildad&#x0027;s language, heterogeneously mixed with<lb/>
Scriptural and domestic phrases.</p>
<pb xml:id="n162" n="145"/>
<p>&#x201C;Avast there, avast there, Bildad; avast now<lb/>
spoiling our harpooneer,&#x201D; cried Peleg. &#x201C;Pious<lb/>
harpooneers never make good voyagers&#x2014;it takes<lb/>
the shark out of &#x0027;em: no harpooneer is worth a<lb/>
straw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young<lb/>
Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of<lb/>
all Nantucket and the Vineyard: he joined the<lb/>
meeting, and never came to good. He got so<lb/>
frightened about his plaguy soul, that he shrinked<lb/>
and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-<lb/>
claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy<lb/>
Jones.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Peleg! Peleg!&#x201D; said Bildad, lifting his eyes<lb/>
and hands, &#x201C;thou thyself, as I myself, hast seen<lb/>
many a perilous time: thou knowest, Peleg, what<lb/>
it is to have the fear of death; how, then, canst<lb/>
thou prate in this ungodly guise? Thou beliest<lb/>
thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this same<lb/>
Pequod here had her three masts overboard in<lb/>
that typhoon on Japan, that same voyage when<lb/>
thou went mate with Captain Ahab, didst thou<lb/>
not think of Death and the Judgment then?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hear him, hear him now,&#x201D; cried Peleg, march-<lb/>
ing across the cabin, and thrusting his hands far<lb/>
down into his pockets,&#x2014;&#x201C;hear him, all of ye.<lb/>
Think of that! When every moment we thought<lb/>
the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment<lb/>
then! What? With all three masts making<lb/>
such an everlasting thundering against the side,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n163" n="146"/>
and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft.<lb/>
Think of Death and the Judgment then ? No!<lb/>
no time to think about Death then. Life was<lb/>
what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and<lb/>
Low to save all hands&#x2014;how to rig jury-masts&#x2014;<lb/>
how to get into the nearest port&#x2014;that was what<lb/>
I was thinking of.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat,<lb/>
stalked on deck, where we followed him. There<lb/>
he stood, very quietly overlooking some sail-<lb/>
makers who were mending a top-sail in the waist.<lb/>
Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch, or<lb/>
save an end of the tarred twine, which otherwise<lb/>
might have been wasted.</p>

<p>Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and<lb/>
were sauntering away from the water, for the<lb/>
moment each occupied with his own thoughts,<lb/>
when the above words were put to us by a<lb/>
stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n164" n="147"/>
massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He<lb/>
was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and<lb/>
patched trowsers, a rag of a black handkerchief<lb/>
investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had<lb/>
in all directions flowed over his face, and left it<lb/>
like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent, when<lb/>
the rushing waters have been dried up.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Have ye shipped in her?&#x201D; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You mean the ship <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>, I suppose,&#x201D; said<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Aye, the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>&#x2014;that ship there,&#x201D; he said,<lb/>
drawing back his whole arm, and then rapidly shoving it<lb/>
straight out from him, with the fixed<lb/>
bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the<lb/>
object.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;we have just signed the ar-<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Anything down there about your souls?&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Oh, perhaps you hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t got any,&#x201D; he said<lb/>

sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What are you jabbering about, shipmate?&#x201D;<lb/>
said I.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="i">He&#x0027;s</hi> got enough, though, to make up for all<lb/>
deficiencies of that sort in other chaps,&#x201D; abruptly<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n165" n="148"/>
said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon<lb/>
the word <hi rend="i">he</hi>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Queequeg,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;let&#x0027;s go: this fellow has<lb/>
broken loose from somewhere: he&#x0027;s talking about<lb/>
something and somebody we don&#x0027;t know.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stop!&#x201D; cried the stranger, &#x201C;Ye said true&#x2014;<lb/>
ye hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t seen Old Thunder yet, have ye?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who&#x0027;s Old Thunder?&#x201D; said I, again riveted<lb/>
with the insane earnestness of his manner.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he<lb/>
goes by that name. Ye hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t seen him yet,<lb/>
have ye?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, we hav&#x0027;n&#x0027;t. He&#x0027;s sick they say, but is<lb/>
getting better, and will be all right again before<lb/>
long.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All right again before long!&#x201D; laughed the<lb/>
stranger, with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh.<lb/>
&#x2018;Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then<lb/>
this left arm of mine will be all right&#x2014;not before.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do you know about him?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What did they <hi rend="i">tell</hi> you about him? Say<lb/>
that!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;They didn&#x0027;t tell much of anything about him;<lb/>
only I&#x0027;ve heard that he&#x0027;s a good whale-hunter,<lb/>
and a good captain to his crew.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;That&#x0027;s true, that&#x0027;s true &#x2014; yes, both true<lb/>
enough. But you must jump when he gives an<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n166" n="149"/>
order. Step and growl; growl and go&#x2014;that&#x0027;s the<lb/>
word with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that<lb/>
thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long<lb/>
ago, when he lay like dead for three days and<lb/>
nights &#x2014; nothing about that deadly skrimmage<lb/>
with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa?&#x2014;<lb/>
heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about<lb/>
the silver calabash he spat into? And nothing<lb/>
about his losing his leg last voyage, according to<lb/>
the prophecy? Didn&#x0027;t ye hear a word about them<lb/>
matters and something more, eh? No, I don&#x0027;t<lb/>
think ye did: how could ye? Who knows it?<lb/>
Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows&#x0027;ever,<lb/>
mayhap, ye&#x0027;ve heard tell about the leg, and how<lb/>
he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say.<lb/>
Oh yes, <hi rend="i">that</hi> every one knows a&#x0027;most&#x2014;I mean<lb/>
they know he&#x0027;s only one leg; and that a par-<lb/>
macetti took the other off.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;My friend,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;what all this gibberish<lb/>
of yours is about, I don&#x0027;t know, and I don&#x0027;t much<lb/>
care; for it seems to me that you must be a little<lb/>
damaged in the head. But if you are speaking<lb/>
of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>,<lb/>
then let me tell you, that I know all about the<lb/>
loss of his leg.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="i">All</hi> about it, eh&#x2014;sure you do?&#x2014;all?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Pretty sure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With finger pointed and eye levelled at the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>, the beggar-like stranger stood a moment,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n167" n="150"/>
as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little,<lb/>
turned and said:&#x2014;&#x201C;Ye&#x0027;ve shipped, have ye?<lb/>
Names down on the papers? Well, well, what&#x0027;s<lb/>
signed, is signed; and what&#x0027;s to be, will be; and<lb/>
then again, perhaps it won&#x0027;t be, after all. Any<lb/>
how, it&#x0027;s all fixed and arranged a&#x0027;ready; and<lb/>
some sailors or other must go with him, I sup-<lb/>
pose; as well these as any other men, God pity<lb/>
&#x0027;em! Morning to ye, shipmates&#x2014;morning; the<lb/>
ineffable heavens bless ye; I&#x0027;m sorry I stopped ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look here, friend,&#x201D; said I; &#x201C;if you have<lb/>
anything important to tell us, out with it; but if<lb/>
you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are<lb/>
mistaken in your game; that&#x0027;s all I have to say.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And it&#x0027;s said very well, and I like to hear a<lb/>
chap talk up that way: you are just the man for<lb/>
him&#x2014;the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates&#x2014;<lb/>
morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell &#x0027;em I&#x0027;ve<lb/>
concluded not to make one of &#x0027;em.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ah, my dear fellow, you can&#x0027;t fool us that<lb/>
way&#x2014;you can&#x0027;t fool us. It is the easiest thing in<lb/>
the world for a man to look as if he had a great<lb/>
secret in him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Morning to ye, shipmates&#x2014;morning.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Morning it is,&#x201D; said I. &#x201C;Come along, Quee-<lb/>
queg; let&#x0027;s leave this crazy man. But stop! tell<lb/>
me your name, will you?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Elijah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n168" n="151"/>
commenting, after each other&#x0027;s fashion, upon this<lb/>
ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was nothing<lb/>
but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we<lb/>
had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards,<lb/>
when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back<lb/>
as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah follow-<lb/>
ing us, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight<lb/>
of him struck me so, that I said nothing to Quee-<lb/>
queg of his being behind, but passed on with my<lb/>
comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger<lb/>
would turn the same corner that we did. He did:<lb/>
and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,<lb/>
but with what intent I could not for the life of me<lb/>
imagine. This circumstance, coupled with his<lb/>
ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing, shrouded<lb/>
sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague<lb/>
wonderments and half-apprehensions, and all con-<lb/>
nected with the <hi rend="i">Pequod;</hi> and Captain Ahab; and<lb/>
the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and<lb/>
the silver calabash; and what Captain Peleg had<lb/>
said of him, when I left the ship the day previous;<lb/>
and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the<lb/>
voyage we had bound ourselves to sail&#x2014;and a<lb/>
hundred other shadowy things.</p>
<p>I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this<lb/>
ragged Elijah was really dogging us or not, and<lb/>
with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,<lb/>
and on that side of it retraced our steps. But<lb/>
Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n169" n="152"/>
This relieved me; and once more&#x2014;and finally as<lb/>
it seemed to me&#x2014;I pronounced him in my heart,<lb/>
a humbug.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d20" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XX.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">all astir</hi>.</head>
<p>A <hi rend="sc">day</hi> or two passed, and there was great activity<lb/>
aboard the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>. Not only were the old sails<lb/>
being mended, but new sails were coming on<lb/>
board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging;<lb/>
in short, everything betokened that the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
preparations were hurrying to a close. Captain<lb/>
Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his<lb/>
wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands;<lb/>
Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the<lb/>
stores; and the men employed in the hold and on<lb/>
the rigging were working till long after nightfall.</p>
<p>On the day following Queequeg&#x0027;s signing the<lb/>
articles, word was given at all the inns where<lb/>
the ship&#x0027;s company were stopping, that their<lb/>
chests must be on board before night, for there<lb/>
was no telling how soon the vessel might be sail-<lb/>
ing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,<lb/>
resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n170" n="153"/>
But it seems they always give very long notice in<lb/>
these cases, and the ship did not sail for several<lb/>
days. But no wonder: there was a good deal to<lb/>
be done, and there is no telling how many things<lb/>
to be thought of, before the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> was fully<lb/>
equipped.</p>
<p>Every one knows what a multitude of things&#x2014;<lb/>
beds, saucepans, knives and forks, shovels and<lb/>
tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not&#x2014;are<lb/>
indispensable to the business of housekeeping.<lb/>
Just so with whaling, which necessitates a three-<lb/>
years&#x0027; housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from<lb/>
all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and<lb/>
bankers. And though this also holds true of<lb/>
merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the<lb/>
same extent as with whalemen. For, besides<lb/>
the great length of the whaling voyage, the<lb/>
numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of<lb/>
the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing<lb/>
them at the remote harbours usually frequented,<lb/>
it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling<lb/>
vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all<lb/>
kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss<lb/>
of the very things upon which the success of the<lb/>
voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats,<lb/>
spare spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and<lb/>
spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain<lb/>
and duplicate ship.</p>
<p>At the period of our arrival at the island, the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n171" n="154"/>
heaviest stowage of the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> had been almost<lb/>
completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,<lb/>
fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before<lb/>
hinted, for some time there was a continual fetch-<lb/>
ing and carrying on board of divers odds and ends<lb/>
of things, both large and small.</p>
<p>Chief among those who did this fetching and<lb/>
carrying was Captain Bildad&#x0027;s sister, a lean old<lb/>
lady of a most determined and indefatigable<lb/>
spirit, but withal very kind-hearted; who seemed<lb/>
resolved that, if <hi rend="i">she</hi> could help it, nothing should<lb/>
be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly<lb/>
getting to sea. At one time she would come on<lb/>
board with a jar of pickles for the steward&#x0027;s<lb/>
pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for<lb/>
the chief mate&#x0027;s desk, where he kept his log; a<lb/>
third time with a roll of flannel for the small<lb/>
of some one&#x0027;s rheumatic back. Never did any<lb/>
woman better deserve her name, which was Cha-<lb/>
rity &#x2014; Aunt Charity, as everybody called her.<lb/>
And like a sister of charity did this charitable<lb/>
Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither,<lb/>
ready to turn her hand and heart to anything<lb/>
that promised to yield safety, comfort, and con-<lb/>
solation to all on board a ship in which her be-<lb/>
loved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which<lb/>
she herself owned a score or two of well-saved<lb/>
dollars.</p>
<p>But it was startling to see this excellent hearted<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n172" n="155"/>
Quakeress coming on board, as she did the last<lb/>
day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still<lb/>
longer whaling-lance in the other. Nor was<lb/>
Bildad himself, nor Captain Peleg, at all back-<lb/>
ward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him<lb/>
a long list of the articles needed, and at every<lb/>
fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that<lb/>
article upon the paper. Every once and a while<lb/>
Peleg came running out of his whalebone den,<lb/>
roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring<lb/>
up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then con-<lb/>
cluded by roaring back into his wigwam.</p>
<p>During these days of preparation, Queequeg<lb/>
and I often visited the craft; and as often I asked<lb/>
about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when<lb/>
he was going to come on board his ship. To<lb/>
these questions they would answer, that he was<lb/>
getting better and better, and was expected<lb/>
aboard every day; meantime the two captains,<lb/>
Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything<lb/>
necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If<lb/>
I had been downright honest with myself, I<lb/>
would have seen very plainly in my heart that<lb/>
I did but half fancy being committed this way to<lb/>
so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on<lb/>
the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it,<lb/>
so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.<lb/>
But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes<lb/>
happens that if he be already involved in the mat-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n173" n="156"/>
ter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions<lb/>
even from himself. And much this way it was<lb/>
with me. I said nothing, and tried to think<lb/>
nothing.</p>
<p>At last it was given out that some time next<lb/>
day the ship would certainly sail. So next morn-<lb/>
ing Queequeg and I took a very early start.</p>
</div1>
<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d21" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">going aboard</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was nearly six o&#x0027;clock&#x2014;but only grey imper-<lb/>
fect misty dawn&#x2014;when we drew nigh the wharf.</p>
<p>&#x201C;There are some sailors running ahead there,<lb/>
if I see right,&#x201D; said I to Queequeg. &#x201C;It can&#x0027;t be<lb/>
shadows. She&#x0027;s off by sunrise, I guess; come<lb/>
on!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Avast!&#x201D; cried a voice, whose owner at the<lb/>
same time coming close behind us, laid a hand<lb/>
upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating<lb/>
himself between us, stood stooping forward a<lb/>
little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering<lb/>
from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Going aboard?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n174" n="157"/>
<p>&#x201C;Hands off, will you?&#x201D; said I.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lookee here,&#x201D; said Queequeg, shaking him-<lb/>
self, &#x201C;go &#x0027;way!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aint going aboard, then?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Yes, we are,&#x201D; said I. But what business is<lb/>
that of yours? Do you know, Mr. Elijah, that<lb/>
I consider you a little impertinent?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, no, no; I wasn&#x0027;t aware of that,&#x201D; said<lb/>
Elijah, slowly, and wonderingly looking from<lb/>
me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable<lb/>
glances.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Elijah,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;you will oblige my friend<lb/>
and me by withdrawing. We are going to the<lb/>
Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not<lb/>
to be detained.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He&#x0027;s cracked, Queequeg,&#x201D; said I; come on.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Holloa!&#x201D; cried stationary Elijah, hailing us<lb/>
when he had removed a few paces.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Never mind him,&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;Queequeg;<lb/>
come on,&#x201D;</p>
<p>But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clap-<lb/>
ping his hand on my shoulder, said&#x2014;&#x201C;Did ye see<lb/>
anything looking like men going towards that<lb/>
ship a while ago?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question,<lb/>
I answered, saying, &#x201C;Yes, I thought I did see four<lb/>
or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n175" n="158"/>
<p>&#x201C;Very dim, very dim,&#x201D; said Elijah. &#x201C;Morn-<lb/>
ing to ye.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once more we quitted him; but once more he<lb/>
came softly after us; and touching my shoulder<lb/>
again, said, &#x201C;See if you can find &#x0027;em now;<lb/>
will ye?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Find who?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Morning to ye! morning to ye!&#x201D; he rejoined,<lb/>
again moving off. &#x201C;Oh! I was going to warn ye<lb/>
against&#x2014;but never mind, never mind&#x2014;it&#x0027;s all one:<lb/>
all in the family too;&#x2014;sharp frost this morning,<lb/>
aint it? Good bye to ye. Shan&#x0027;t see ye again<lb/>
very soon, I guess; unless it&#x0027;s before the Grand<lb/>
Jury.&#x201D; And with these cracked words he finally<lb/>
departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small<lb/>
wonderment at his frantic impudence.</p>
<p>At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found<lb/>
everything in profound quiet&#x2014;not a soul moving.<lb/>
The cabin entrance was locked within; the hatches<lb/>
were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging.<lb/>
Going forward to the forecastle, we found the slide<lb/>
of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down,<lb/>
and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a<lb/>
tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole<lb/>
length upon two chests, his face downwards and<lb/>
inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest<lb/>
slumber was upon him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n176" n="159"/>
they have gone to?&#x201D; said I, looking dubiously at<lb/>
the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the<lb/>
wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now<lb/>
alluded to: hence I should have thought myself<lb/>
to have been optically deceived in that matter,<lb/>
were it not for Elijah&#x0027;s otherwise inexplicable<lb/>
question. But I beat the thing down; and again<lb/>
marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg<lb/>
that perhaps we had best sit up with the body;<lb/>
telling him to establish himself accordingly. He<lb/>
put his hand upon the sleeper&#x0027;s rear, as though<lb/>
feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without<lb/>
more ado, sat quietly down there.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gracious! Queequeg, don&#x0027;t sit there,&#x201D; said I.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh! perry dood seat,&#x201D; said Queequeg, &#x201C;my<lb/>
country way: won&#x0027;t hurt him face.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Face!&#x201D; said I, &#x201C;call that his face? very bene-<lb/>
volent countenance then. But how hard he<lb/>
breathes; he&#x0027;s heaving himself. Get off, Queequeg;<lb/>
you are heavy; it&#x0027;s grinding the face of the poor.<lb/>
Get off, Queequeg! Look, he&#x0027;ll twitch you off<lb/>
soon. I wonder he don&#x0027;t wake.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the<lb/>
head of the sleeper, and lighted his tomahawk pipe.<lb/>
I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing over<lb/>
the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile,<lb/>
upon questioning him, in his broken fashion<lb/>
Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land,<lb/>
owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n177" n="160"/>
sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people generally,<lb/>
were in the custom of fattening some of the lower<lb/>
orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house com-<lb/>
fortably in that respect, you had only to buy up<lb/>
eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in<lb/>
the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very con-<lb/>
venient on an excursion&#x2014;much better than those<lb/>
garden-chairs which are convertible into walking-<lb/>
sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant,<lb/>
and desiring him to make a settee of himself under<lb/>
a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy<lb/>
place.</p>
<p>While narrating these things, every time Quee-<lb/>
queg received the tomahawk from me, he flourished<lb/>
the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper&#x0027;s head.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x0027;s that for, Queequeg?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!&#x201D;</p>
<p>He was going on with some wild reminiscences<lb/>
about his tomahawk-pipe, which, it seemed, had<lb/>
in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed<lb/>
his soul, when we were directly attracted to the<lb/>
sleeping rigger. The strong vapour now completely<lb/>
filling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon<lb/>
him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness;<lb/>
then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved<lb/>
over once or twice; then sat up and rubbed<lb/>
his eyes.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Holloa!&#x201D; he breathed at last, &#x201C;who be ye<lb/>
smokers?&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n178" n="161"/>
<p>&#x201C;Shipped men,&#x201D; answered I; &#x201C;when does she<lb/>
sail?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She<lb/>
sails to-day. The captain came aboard last night.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What Captain?&#x2014;Ahab?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who but him indeed?&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was going to ask him some further questions<lb/>
concerning Ahab, when we heard a noise on deck.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Halloa! Starbuck&#x0027;s astir,&#x201D; said the rigger.<lb/>
&#x201C;He&#x0027;s a lively chief mate, that; good man, and<lb/>
a pious; but all alive now. I must turn to.&#x201D;<lb/>
And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.</p>
<p>It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came<lb/>
on board in twos and threes; the riggers bestirred<lb/>
themselves; the mates were actively engaged;<lb/>
and several of the shore people were busy in bring-<lb/>

Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within<lb/>
his cabin.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">At</hi> length, towards noon, upon the final dis-<lb/>
missal of the ship&#x0027;s riggers, and after the Pequod<lb/>
had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n179" n="162"/>
ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-<lb/>
boat, with her last gift&#x2014;a night-cap for Stubb,<lb/>
the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare<lb/>
Bible for the steward&#x2014;after all this, the two<lb/>
captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin,<lb/>
and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything<lb/>
is right? Captain Ahab is all ready&#x2014;just spoke<lb/>
to him&#x2014;nothing more to be got from shore, eh?<lb/>
Well, call all hands, then. Muster &#x0027;em aft here<lb/>
&#x2014;b&#x2014;t &#x0027;em!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;No need of profane words, however great the<lb/>
hurry, Peleg,&#x201D; said Bildad, &#x201C;but away with thee,<lb/>
friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.&#x201D;</p>
<p>How now! Here upon the very point of starting<lb/>
for the voyage, Captain Peleg and Captain Bildad<lb/>
were going it with a high hand on the quarter-<lb/>
deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders<lb/>
at sea, as well as to all appearances in port. And,<lb/>
as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be<lb/>
seen; only they said he was in the cabin. But<lb/>
then, the idea was, that his presence was by no<lb/>
means necessary in getting the ship under weigh,<lb/>
and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that<lb/>
was not at all his proper business, but the pilot&#x0027;s,<lb/>
and as he was not yet completely recovered&#x2014;so<lb/>
they said&#x2014;therefore, Captain Ahab stayed below.<lb/>
And all this seemed natural enough; especially as<lb/>
in the merchant service many captains never show<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n180" n="163"/>
themselves on deck for a considerable time after<lb/>
heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin<lb/>
table, having a farewell merry-making with their<lb/>
shore friends, before they quit the ship for good<lb/>
with the pilot.</p>
<p>But there was not much chance to think over<lb/>
the matter, for Captain Peleg was now all alive.<lb/>
He seemed to do most of the talking and com-<lb/>
manding, and not Bildad.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,&#x201D; he cried, as<lb/>
the sailors lingered at the main-mast. &#x201C;Mr. Star-<lb/>
buck, drive &#x0027;em aft.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Strike the tent there!&#x201D;&#x2014;was the next order.<lb/>
As I hinted before, this whalebone marquee was<lb/>
never pitched except in port; and on board the<lb/>
Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the<lb/>
tent was well known to be the next thing to heav-<lb/>
ing up the anchor.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!&#x2014;<lb/>
jump!&#x201D;&#x2014;was the next command, and the crew<lb/>
sprang for the handspikes.</p>
<p>Now, in getting under weigh, the station gene-<lb/>
rally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of<lb/>
the ship. And here Bildad&#x2014;who, with Peleg, be<lb/>
it known, in addition to his other offices, was one<lb/>
of the licensed pilots of the port&#x2014;he being sus-<lb/>
pected to have got himself made a pilot in order<lb/>
to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he<lb/>
was concerned in, for he never piloted any other<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n181" n="164"/>
craft&#x2014;Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively<lb/>
engaged in looking over the bows for the ap-<lb/>
proaching anchor, and at intervals singing what<lb/>
seemed a dismal stave of psalmody, to cheer the<lb/>
hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort<lb/>
of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with<lb/>
hearty good will. Nevertheless, not three days<lb/>
previous, Bildad had told them that no profane<lb/>
songs would he allowed on board the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>,<lb/>
particularly in getting under weigh: and Charity,<lb/>
his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts<lb/>
in each seaman&#x0027;s berth.</p>
<p>Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship,<lb/>
Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most<lb/>
frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink<lb/>
the ship before the anchor could be got up. In-<lb/>
voluntarily I paused on my handspike, and told<lb/>
Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils<lb/>
we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such<lb/>
a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, how-<lb/>
ever, with the thought that in pious Bildad might<lb/>
be found some salvation, spite of his seven hun-<lb/>
dred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sud-<lb/>
den sharp poke in my rear, and turning round,<lb/>
was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in<lb/>
the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate<lb/>
vicinity. That was my first kick.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Is that the way they heave in the marchant<lb/>
service?&#x201D; he roared. &#x201C;Spring, thou sheep-head;<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n182" n="165"/>
spring, and break thy back-bone! Why don&#x0027;t ye<lb/>
spring, I say, all of ye! spring! Quohog! spring,<lb/>
thou chap with the red whiskers! spring there,<lb/>
Scotch-cap! spring, thou green pants. Spring,<lb/>
I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!&#x201D; And<lb/>
so saying, he moved along the windlass, here and<lb/>
there using his leg very freely, while impertur-<lb/>
bable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.<lb/>
Thinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking<lb/>
something to-day.</p>
<p>At last the anchor was up, the sails were set,<lb/>
and off we glided. It was a short, cold Christmas;<lb/>
and as the short northern day merged into night,<lb/>
we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry<lb/>
ocean, whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in<lb/>
polished armour. The long rows of teeth on the<lb/>
bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like<lb/>
the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast<lb/>
curving icicles depended from the bows.</p>
<p>Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch,<lb/>
and ever and anon, as the old craft deep dived<lb/>
into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost<lb/>
all over her, and the winds howled, and the cord-<lb/>
age rang, his steady notes were heard,&#x2014;</p>
<lg type="verse">
<l>&#x201C;Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,</l>
<l rend="indent">Stand dress&#x0027;d in living green.</l>
<l>So to the Jews old Canaan stood,</l>
<l rend="indent">While Jordan roll&#x0027;d between.&#x201D;</l>
</lg>
<pb xml:id="n183" n="166"/>
<p>Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly<lb/>
to me than then. They were full of hope and<lb/>
fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the<lb/>
boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wet-<lb/>
ter jacket, there was yet&#x2014;it then seemed to me&#x2014;<lb/>
many a pleasant haven in store; and meads and<lb/>
glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up<lb/>
by the spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at<lb/>
midsummer.</p>
<p>At last we gained such an offing, that the two<lb/>
pilots were needed no longer. The stout sail-boat<lb/>
that had accompanied us began ranging alongside.</p>
<p>It was curious, and not unpleasing, how Peleg<lb/>
and Bildad were affected at this juncture&#x2014;espe-<lb/>
cially Captain Bildad. For loth to depart yet;<lb/>
very loth to leave, for good, a ship bound on so<lb/>
long and perilous a voyage, beyond both stormy<lb/>
Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his<lb/>
hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in<lb/>
which an old shipmate sailed as captain, a man<lb/>
almost as old as he, once more starting to en-<lb/>
counter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath<lb/>
to say good-bye to a thing so every way brimful<lb/>
of every interest to him,&#x2014;poor old Bildad lingered<lb/>
long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran<lb/>
down into the cabin to speak another farewell word<lb/>
there; again came on deck, and looked to wind-<lb/>
ward; looked towards the wide and endless waters,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n184" n="167"/>
only bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Con-<lb/>
tinents; looked towards the land; looked aloft;<lb/>
looked right and left; looked everywhere and<lb/>
nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope<lb/>
upon its pin, convulsively grasped stout Peleg by<lb/>
the hand, and holding up a lantern, for a moment<lb/>
stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to<lb/>
say, &#x201C;Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it;<lb/>
yes, I can.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a<lb/>
philosopher. But for all his philosophy, there<lb/>
was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern<lb/>
came too near. And he, too, did not a little run<lb/>
from cabin to deck&#x2014;now a word below, and now<lb/>
a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.</p>
<p>But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a<lb/>
final sort of look about him.&#x2014;&#x201D; Captain Bildad&#x2014;<lb/>
come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-<lb/>
yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close<lb/>
alongside, now! Careful, careful!&#x2014;come, Bildad,<lb/>
boy&#x2014;say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck&#x2014;luck<lb/>
to ye, Mr. Stubb&#x2014;luck to ye, Mr. Flask&#x2014;good-<lb/>
bye, and good luck to ye all&#x2014;and this day three<lb/>
years I&#x0027;ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old<lb/>
Nantucket. Hurrah, and away!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keep-<lb/>
ing, men,&#x201D; murmured old Bildad, almost incohe-<lb/>
rently. &#x201C;I hope ye&#x0027;ll have fine weather now, so<lb/>
that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n185" n="168"/>
ye&#x2014;a pleasant sun is all he needs, and ye&#x0027;ll have<lb/>
plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be<lb/>
careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don&#x0027;t stave the<lb/>
boats needlessly, ye harpooneers; good white cedar<lb/>
plank is raised full three per cent, within the year.<lb/>
Don&#x0027;t forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck,<lb/>
mind that cooper don&#x0027;t waste the spare staves.<lb/>
(Oh! the sail-needles are in the green locker!)<lb/>
Don&#x0027;t whale it too much a&#x0027; Lord&#x0027;s days, men; but<lb/>
don&#x0027;t miss a fair chance either&#x2014;that&#x0027;s rejecting<lb/>
Heaven&#x0027;s good gifts. Have an eye to the molasses<lb/>
tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I thought.<lb/>
Good-bye, good-bye! Don&#x0027;t keep that cheese too<lb/>
long down in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it&#x0027;ll spoil.<lb/>
Be careful with the butter&#x2014;twenty cents the<lb/>
pound it was, and mind ye, if&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,<lb/>
&#x2014;away!&#x201D; and with that, Peleg hurried him over<lb/>
the side, and both dropped into the boat.</p>
<p>Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night<lb/>
breeze blew between; a screaming gull flew over-<lb/>
head; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave three<lb/>
heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like<lb/>
fate into the lone Atlantic.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the lee shore</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Some</hi> chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken<lb/>
of, a tall, new-landed mariner, encountered in New<lb/>
Bedford at the inn.</p>
<p>When on that shivering winter&#x0027;s night, the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> thrust her vindictive bows into the cold<lb/>
malicious waves, who should I see standing at her<lb/>
helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic<lb/>
awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in mid-<lb/>
winter, just landed from a four years&#x0027; dangerous<lb/>
voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for<lb/>
still another tempestuous term. The land seemed<lb/>
scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are<lb/>
ever the unmentionable: deep memories yield no<lb/>
epitaphs: this six-inch chapter is the stoneless<lb/>
grave of Bulkington. Let me only say that it<lb/>
fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that<lb/>
miserably drives along the leeward land. The<lb/>
port would fain give succour; the port is pitiful:<lb/>
in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone, supper,<lb/>
warm blankets, friends, all that&#x0027;s kind to our mor-<lb/>
talities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n187" n="170"/>
that ship&#x0027;s direst jeopardy. She must fly all<lb/>
hospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze<lb/>
the keel, would make her shudder through and<lb/>
through. With all her might she crowds all sail<lb/>
off shore: in so doing, fights against the very<lb/>
winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks<lb/>
all the lashed sea&#x0027;s landlessness again; for refuge&#x0027;s<lb/>
sake forlornly rushing into peril&#x2014;her only friend<lb/>
her bitterest foe!</p>
<p>Know ye now Bulkington? Glimpses do ye<lb/>
seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth; that<lb/>
all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid<lb/>
effort of the soul to keep the open independence<lb/>
of her sea; while the wildest winds of heaven and<lb/>
earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous,<lb/>
slavish shore?</p>
<p>But as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth,<lb/>
shoreless, indefinite as the Almighty&#x2014;so,<lb/>
better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than<lb/>
be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that<lb/>
were safety! For worm-like, then, oh! who would<lb/>
craven crawl to land? Terrors of the terrible! is<lb/>
all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart,<lb/>
O Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demi-god! Up<lb/>
from the spray of thy ocean-perishing&#x2014;straight<lb/>
up, leaps thy apotheosis!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXIV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the advocate</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">As</hi> Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in<lb/>
this business of whaling, and as this business of<lb/>
whaling has somehow come to be regarded among<lb/>
landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable<lb/>
pursuit, therefore, I am all anxiety to convince ye,<lb/>
ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done to us<lb/>
hunters of whales.</p>
<p>In the first place, it may be deemed almost<lb/>
superfluous to establish the fact, that among people<lb/>
at large, the business of whaling is not accounted<lb/>
on a level with what are called the liberal profes-<lb/>
sions. If a stranger were introduced into any<lb/>
miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but<lb/>
slightly advance the general opinion of his merits,<lb/>
were he presented to the company as a harpooneer,<lb/>
say; and if, in emulation of the naval officers, he<lb/>
should append the initials S. W. F. (Sperm Whale<lb/>
Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure<lb/>
would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and<lb/>
ridiculous.</p>
<p>Doubtless, one leading reason why the world<lb/>
declines honouring us whalemen, is this: they<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n189" n="172"/>
think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a<lb/>
butchering sort of business; and that when ac-<lb/>
tively engaged therein, we are surrounded by all<lb/>
manner of defilements. Butchers we are&#x2014;that is<lb/>
true. But butchers also, and butchers of the<lb/>
bloodiest badge, have been all martial commanders,<lb/>
whom the world invariably delights to honour.<lb/>
And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness<lb/>
of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into<lb/>
certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown,<lb/>
and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly<lb/>
plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the<lb/>
cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even<lb/>
granting the charge in question to be true: what<lb/>
disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are com-<lb/>
parable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-<lb/>
fields from which so many soldiers return to drink<lb/>
in all ladies&#x0027; plaudits? And if the idea of peril so<lb/>
much enhances the popular conceit of the sol-<lb/>
dier&#x0027;s profession, let me assure ye that many a<lb/>
veteran who has freely marched up to a battery,<lb/>
would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm<lb/>
whale&#x0027;s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over<lb/>
his head. For what are the comprehensible ter-<lb/>
rors of man compared with the interlinked terrors<lb/>
and wonders of God!</p>
<p>But, though the world scouts at us whale-<lb/>
hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay us the pro-<lb/>
foundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration!<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n190" n="173"/>
For almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that<lb/>
burn round the globe, burn, as before so many<lb/>
shrines, to our glory!</p>
<p>But look at this matter in other lights: weigh<lb/>
it in all sorts of scales: see what we whalemen<lb/>
are, and have been.</p>
<p>Why did the Dutch in De Witt&#x0027;s time have<lb/>
admirals of their whaling fleets? Why did Louis<lb/>
XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit<lb/>
out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely in-<lb/>
vite to that town some score or two of families<lb/>
from our own island of Nantucket? Why did<lb/>
Britain, between the years 1750 and 1788, pay to<lb/>
her whalemen in bounties upwards of &#x00A3;1,000,000?<lb/>
And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of<lb/>
America now outnumber all the rest of the<lb/>
banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of up-<lb/>
wards of seven hundred vessels, manned by eigh-<lb/>
teen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000<lb/>
of dollars: the ships&#x0027; worth, at the time of sailing,<lb/>
&#x0024;20,000,000; and every year importing into our<lb/>
harbours a well-reaped harvest of &#x0024;7,000,000.<lb/>
How comes all this, if there be not something<lb/>
puissant in whaling?</p>
<p>But this is not the half: look again.</p>
<p>I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher<lb/>
cannot, for his life, point out one single peaceful<lb/>
influence, which within the last sixty years has<lb/>
operated more potentially upon the whole broad<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n191" n="174"/>
world, taken in one aggregate, than the high and<lb/>
mighty business of whaling. One way and an-<lb/>
other, it has begotten events so remarkable in<lb/>
themselves, and so continuously momentous in<lb/>
their sequential issues, that whaling may well be<lb/>
regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore off-<lb/>
spring themselves pregnant from her womb. It<lb/>
would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue<lb/>
all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many<lb/>
years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in<lb/>
ferreting out the remotest and least known parts<lb/>
of the earth. She has explored seas and archi-<lb/>
pelagos which had no chart, where no Cook or<lb/>
Vancouver had ever sailed. If American and<lb/>
European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once<lb/>
savage harbours, let them fire salutes to the honour<lb/>
and the glory of the whale-ship, which originally<lb/>
showed them the way, and first interpreted be-<lb/>
tween them and the savages. They may cele-<lb/>
brate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expe-<lb/>
ditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say<lb/>
that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed<lb/>
out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater<lb/>
than your Cook and your Krusenstern. For in<lb/>
their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the<lb/>
heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of<lb/>
unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin<lb/>
wonders and terrors, that Cook, with all his<lb/>
marines and muskets, would not willingly have<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n192" n="175"/>
dared. All that is made such a flourish of in the<lb/>
old South Sea Voyages&#x2014;those things were but<lb/>
the life-time common-places of our heroic Nan-<lb/>
tucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver<lb/>
dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted<lb/>
unworthy of being set down in the ship&#x0027;s common<lb/>
log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!</p>
<p>Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no<lb/>
commerce but colonial, scarcely any intercourse<lb/>
but colonial, was carried on between Europe and<lb/>
the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on<lb/>
the Pacific coast. It was the whaleman who first<lb/>
broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish<lb/>
crown, touching these colonies; and, if space per-<lb/>
mitted, it might be distinctly shown how from<lb/>
those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation<lb/>
of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old<lb/>
Spain, and the establishment of the eternal demo-<lb/>
cracy in those parts.</p>
<p>That great America on the other side of the<lb/>
sphere&#x2014;Australia&#x2014;was given to the enlightened<lb/>
world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-<lb/>
born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships<lb/>
long shunned those shores as pestiferously bar-<lb/>
barous; but the whale-ship touched there. The<lb/>
whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty<lb/>
colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first<lb/>
Australian settlement, the emigrants were several<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n193" n="176"/>
times saved from starvation by the benevolent bis-<lb/>
cuit of the whale-ship, luckily dropping an anchor<lb/>
in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Poly-<lb/>
nesia confess the same truth, and do commercial<lb/>
homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way<lb/>
for the missionary and the merchant, and in many<lb/>
cases carried the primitive missionaries to their<lb/>
first destinations. If that double-bolted land,<lb/>
Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the<lb/>
whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due;<lb/>
for already she is on the threshold.</p>
<p>But if, in the face of all this, you still declare<lb/>
that whaling has no aesthetically noble associations<lb/>
connected with it, then am I ready to shiver fifty<lb/>
lances with you there, and unhorse you with a<lb/>
split helmet every time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The whale has no famous author, and whaling<lb/>

<pb xml:id="n194" n="177"/>

and kin to noble Benjamin&#x2014;this day darting the<lb/>

<p>&#x201C;Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you<lb/>
will, there is no real dignity in whaling.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n195" n="178"/>
<p><hi rend="i">No dignity in whaling?</hi> The dignity of our<lb/>

<head>CHAPTER XXV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">knights and squires</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">The</hi> chief mate of the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> was Starbuck, a<lb/>
native of Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent.<lb/>
He was a long, earnest man, and though born on<lb/>
icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot lati-<lb/>
tudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit.<lb/>
Transported to the Indies, his live blood would<lb/>
not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been<lb/>
born in some time of general drought and famine,<lb/>
or upon one of those fast days for which his state<lb/>
is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had<lb/>
he seen &#x2014; those summers had dried up all his<lb/>
physical superfluousness. But this his thinness,<lb/>
so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting<lb/>
anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication<lb/>
of any bodily blight. It was merely the conden-<lb/>
sation of the man. He was by no means ill-<lb/>
looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin<lb/>
was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in<lb/>
it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,<lb/>
like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed<lb/>
prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n197" n="180"/>
endure always, as now; for be it polar snow or<lb/>
torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior<lb/>
vitality was warranted to do well in all climates.<lb/>
Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there<lb/>
the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold<lb/>
perils he had calmly confronted through life. A<lb/>
staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part<lb/>
was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame<lb/>
chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety<lb/>
and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him<lb/>
which at times affected, and in some cases seemed<lb/>
well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncom-<lb/>
monly conscientious for a seaman, and endued<lb/>
with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery<lb/>
loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline<lb/>
him to superstition; but to that sort of super-<lb/>
stition, which in some organizations seems rather<lb/>
to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from<lb/>
ignorance. Outward portents and inward presen-<lb/>
timents were his. And if at times these things<lb/>
bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did<lb/>
his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape<lb/>
wife and child, tend to bend him still more from<lb/>
the original ruggedness of his nature, and open<lb/>
him still further to those latent influences which,<lb/>
in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of<lb/>
dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in<lb/>
the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. &#x201C;I<lb/>
will have no man in my boat,&#x201D; said Starbuck,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n198" n="181"/>
&#x201C;who is not afraid of a whale.&#x201D; By this, he<lb/>
seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable<lb/>
and useful courage is that which arises from the<lb/>
fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that<lb/>
an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous<lb/>
comrade than a coward.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye,&#x201D; said Stubb, the second mate,<lb/>
&#x201C;Starbuck, there, is as careful a man as you&#x0027;ll<lb/>
find anywhere in this fishery.&#x201D; But we shall ere<lb/>
long see what that word &#x201C;careful&#x201D; precisely means,<lb/>
when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any<lb/>
whale-hunter.</p>
<p>Starbuck was no crusader after perils: in him<lb/>
courage was not a sentiment, but a thing simply<lb/>
useful to him, and always at hand upon all prac-<lb/>
tical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps,<lb/>
that in this business of whaling, courage was one<lb/>
of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her<lb/>
beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.<lb/>
Wherefore, he had no fancy for lowering for<lb/>
whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in fight-<lb/>
ing a fish that too much persisted in fighting him.<lb/>
For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical<lb/>
ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be<lb/>
killed by them for theirs; and that hundreds of<lb/>
men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.<lb/>
What doom was his own father&#x0027;s&#x2014;where, in the<lb/>
bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs of<lb/>
his brother?</p>
<pb xml:id="n199" n="182"/>
<p>With memories like these in him, and, more-<lb/>
over, given to a certain superstitiousness, as has<lb/>
been said, the courage of this Starbuck which<lb/>
could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have<lb/>
been extreme. But it was not in reasonable nature<lb/>
that a man so organized, and with such terrible<lb/>
experiences and remembrances as he had&#x2014;it was<lb/>
not in nature that these things should fail in<lb/>
latently engendering an element in him, which,<lb/>
under suitable circumstances, would break out<lb/>
from its confinement, and burn all his courage up.<lb/>
And brave as he might be, it was that sort of<lb/>
bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men,<lb/>
which, while generally abiding firm in the conflict<lb/>
with seas, or winds, or whales, or any of the<lb/>
ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet can-<lb/>
not withstand those more terrific, because more<lb/>
spiritual terrors, which sometimes menace you<lb/>
from the concentrating brow of an enraged and<lb/>
mighty man.</p>
<p>But were the coming narrative to reveal, in any<lb/>
instance, the complete abasement of poor Star-<lb/>
buck&#x0027;s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to<lb/>
write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay,<lb/>
shocking, to expose the fall of valour in the soul.<lb/>
Men may seem detestable as joint-stock com-<lb/>
panies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers<lb/>
there may be; men may have mean and meagre<lb/>
faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble and so<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n200" n="183"/>
sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature,<lb/>
that over any ignominious blemish in him all his<lb/>
fellows should run to throw their costliest robes.<lb/>
That immaculate manliness we feel within our-<lb/>
selves&#x2014;so far within us, that it remains intact<lb/>
though all the outer character seem gone&#x2014;bleeds<lb/>
with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle<lb/>
of a valour-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at<lb/>
such a shameful sight, completely stifle her up-<lb/>
braidings against the permitting stars. But this<lb/>
august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of<lb/>
kings and robes, but that abounding dignity which<lb/>
has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining<lb/>
in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike;<lb/>
that democratic dignity which, on all hands,<lb/>
radiates without end from God Himself!</p>
<p>If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades<lb/>
and castaways, I shall hereafter ascribe high<lb/>
qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic<lb/>
graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the<lb/>
most abased, among them all, shall at times lift<lb/>
himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch<lb/>
that workman&#x0027;s arm with some ethereal light; if<lb/>
I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of<lb/>
sun; then, against all mortal critics, bear me out<lb/>
in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast<lb/>
spread one royal mantle of humanity over all<lb/>
my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great God!<lb/>
who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bun-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n201" n="184"/>
yan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe<lb/>
with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold, the<lb/>
stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes;<lb/>
Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from<lb/>
the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a war-<lb/>
horse; who didst thunder him higher than a<lb/>
throne! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly<lb/>
marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions<lb/>
from the kingly commons. Bear me out in it,<lb/>
O God!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXVI.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">knights and squires</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Stubb</hi> was the second mate. He was a native<lb/>
of Cape Cod, and hence, according to local usage,<lb/>
was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;<lb/>
neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they<lb/>
came with an indifferent air; and while engaged<lb/>
in the most imminent crises of the chase, toiling<lb/>
away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner<lb/>
engaged for the year. Good-humoured, easy,<lb/>
and careless, he presided over his whale-boat as<lb/>
if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n202" n="185"/>
and his crew all invited guests. He was as par-<lb/>
ticular about the comfortable arrangement of his<lb/>
part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about<lb/>
the snugness of his box. When close to the<lb/>
whale, in the very death-lock of the fight, he<lb/>
handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly,<lb/>
as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum<lb/>
over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank<lb/>
with the most exasperated monster. Long usage<lb/>
had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death<lb/>
into an easy chair. What he thought of death<lb/>
itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever<lb/>
thought of it at all, might be a question; but, if<lb/>
he ever did chance to cast his mind that way<lb/>
after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good<lb/>
sailor, he took it to be a sort of call of the watch<lb/>
to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about<lb/>
something which he would find out when he<lb/>
obeyed the order, and not sooner.</p>
<p>What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb<lb/>
such an easy-going, unfearing man, so cheerily<lb/>
trudging off with the burden of life in a world<lb/>
full of grave peddlers, all bowed to the ground<lb/>
with their packs; what helped to bring about<lb/>
that almost impious good-humour of his&#x2014;that<lb/>
thing must have been his pipe. For, like his<lb/>
nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the<lb/>
regular features of his face. You would almost<lb/>
as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n203" n="186"/>
without his nose as without his pipe. He kept<lb/>
a whole row of pipes there ready loaded, stuck in<lb/>
a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, when-<lb/>
ever he turned in, he smoked them all out in<lb/>
succession, lighting one from the other to the<lb/>
end of the chapter; then loading them again to<lb/>
be in readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed,<lb/>
instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers,<lb/>
he put his pipe into his mouth.</p>
<p>I say, this continual smoking must have been<lb/>
one cause, at least, of his peculiar disposition;<lb/>
for every one knows that this earthly air, whether<lb/>
ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the<lb/>
nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who<lb/>
have died exhaling it; and as in time of the<lb/>
cholera, some people go about with a camphorated<lb/>
handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against<lb/>
all mortal tribulations, Stubb&#x0027;s tobacco smoke<lb/>
might have operated as a sort of disinfecting<lb/>
agent.</p>
<p>The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury,<lb/>
in Martha&#x0027;s Vineyard; a short, stout, ruddy young<lb/>
fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who<lb/>
somehow seemed to think that the great Leviathans<lb/>
had personally and hereditarily affronted him;<lb/>
and therefore it was a sort of point of honour<lb/>
with him, to destroy them whenever encountered.<lb/>
So utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence<lb/>
for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n204" n="187"/>
mystic ways, and so dead to anything like an<lb/>
apprehension of any possible danger from encoun-<lb/>
tering them, that in his poor opinion, the won-<lb/>
drous whale was but a species of magnified mouse,<lb/>
or at least water-rat, requiring only a little cir-<lb/>
cumvention and some small application of time<lb/>
and trouble in order to kill and boil. This igno-<lb/>
rant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a<lb/>
little waggish in the matter of whales. He fol-<lb/>
lowed these fish for the fun of it; and a three<lb/>
years&#x0027; voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly<lb/>
joke that lasted that length of time. As a car-<lb/>
penter&#x0027;s nails are divided into wrought nails and<lb/>
cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided.<lb/>
Little Flask was one of the wrought ones&#x2014;made<lb/>
to clinch tight and last long. They called him<lb/>
King-Post on board of the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi>; because, in<lb/>
form, he could be well likened to the short, square<lb/>
timber known by that name in arctic whalers;<lb/>
and which by the means of many radiating side<lb/>
timbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship<lb/>
against the icy concussions of those battering seas.</p>
<p>Now these three mates&#x2014;Starbuck, Stubb, and<lb/>
Flask, were momentous men. They it was who<lb/>
by universal consent commanded three of the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Pequod&#x0027;s</hi> boats as headsmen. In that grand order<lb/>
of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably<lb/>
marshal his forces to descend on the whales, these<lb/>
three headsmen were as captains of companies.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n205" n="188"/>
Or, being armed with their long keen whaling<lb/>
spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers; even<lb/>
as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.</p>
<p>And since in this famous fishery, each mate or<lb/>
headsman, like a Gothic Knight of old, is always<lb/>
accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,<lb/>
who in certain conjunctures provides him with a<lb/>
fresh lance, when the former one has been badly<lb/>
twisted or elbowed in the assault; and moreover,<lb/>
as there generally subsists between the two, a<lb/>
close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore<lb/>
but meet, that in this place we set down who the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Pequod&#x0027;s</hi> harpooneers were, and to what heads-<lb/>
man each of them belonged.</p>
<p>First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the<lb/>
chief mate, had selected for his squire. But<lb/>
Queequeg is already known.</p>
<p>Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from<lb/>
Gay Head, the most westerly promontory of Mar-<lb/>
tha&#x0027;s Vineyard, where there still exists the last<lb/>
remnant of a village of red men, which has long<lb/>
supplied the neighbouring island of Nantucket with<lb/>
many of her most daring harpooneers. In the<lb/>
fishery, they usually go by the generic name of<lb/>
Gay Headers. Tashtego&#x0027;s long, lean, sable hair,<lb/>
his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes&#x2014;-<lb/>
for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but<lb/>
Antarctic in their glittering expression&#x2014;all this<lb/>
sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n206" n="189"/>
unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters,<lb/>
who, in quest of the great New England moose,<lb/>
had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests<lb/>
of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail<lb/>
of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now<lb/>
hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea;<lb/>
the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the<lb/>
infallible arrow of the sires. To look at the tawny<lb/>
brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost<lb/>
have credited the superstitions of some of the<lb/>
earlier Puritans, and half believed this wild Indian<lb/>
to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.<lb/>
Tashtego was Stubb the second mate&#x0027;s squire.</p>
<p>Third among the harpooneers, was Daggoo, a<lb/>
gigantic, coal-black negro-savage, with a lion-like<lb/>
tread&#x2014;an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended from<lb/>
his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the<lb/>
sailors called them ring-bolts, and would talk of<lb/>
securing the top-sail halyards to them. In his<lb/>
youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board<lb/>
of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native<lb/>
coast; and never having been anywhere in the<lb/>
world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan<lb/>
harbours most frequented by whalemen; and<lb/>
having now led for many years the bold life of<lb/>
the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly<lb/>
heedful of what manner of men they shipped;<lb/>
Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect<lb/>
as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n207" n="190"/>
pomp of six feet five in his socks. There was a<lb/>
corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a<lb/>
white man standing before him seemed a white<lb/>
flag come to beg truce of a fortress. Curious to<lb/>
tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was<lb/>
the squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-<lb/>
man beside him. As for the residue of the <hi rend="i">Pe-<lb/>
quod&#x0027;s</hi> company, be it said, that at the present<lb/>
day not one in two of the many thousand men<lb/>
before the mast employed in the American whale<lb/>
fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly<lb/>
all the officers are. Herein it is the same with<lb/>
the American whale fishery, as with the American<lb/>
army and military and merchant navies, and the<lb/>
engineering forces employed in the construction<lb/>
of the American Canals and Railroads&#x2014;the same,<lb/>
I say, because in all these cases the native Ameri-<lb/>
can liberally provides the brains, the rest of the<lb/>
world as generously supplying the muscles. No<lb/>
small number of these whaling seamen belong to<lb/>
the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket<lb/>
whalers frequently touch to augment their crews<lb/>
from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.<lb/>
In like manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out<lb/>
of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland islands,<lb/>
to receive the full complement of their crew.<lb/>
Upon the passage homewards, they drop them<lb/>
there again. How it is, there is no telling, but<lb/>
Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n208" n="191"/>
were nearly all Islanders in the <hi rend="i">Pequod, Isolatos</hi><lb/>
too, I call such, not acknowledging the common<lb/>
continent of men, but each <hi rend="i">Isolato</hi> living on a<lb/>
separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated<lb/>
along one keel, what a set these Isolatos were!<lb/>
&#x2014;an Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the<lb/>
isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth,<lb/>
accompanying Old Ahab in the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> to lay the<lb/>
world&#x0027;s grievances before that bar from which not<lb/>
very many of them ever come back. Black Little<lb/>
Pip&#x2014;he never did! Poor Alabama boy! On<lb/>
the grim <hi rend="i">Pequod&#x0027;s</hi> forecastle, ye shall ere long see<lb/>
him, beating his tambourine, prelusive of the<lb/>
eternal time, when, sent for to the great quarter-<lb/>
deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels,<lb/>
and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward<lb/>
here, hailed a hero there!</p>

<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d27" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXVII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">ahab</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">For</hi> several days after leaving Nantucket, no-<lb/>
thing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab.<lb/>
The mates regularly relieved each other at the<lb/>
watches, and for aught that could be seen to the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n209" n="192"/>
contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders<lb/>
of the ship: only they sometimes issued from the<lb/>
cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that<lb/>
after all it was plain they but commanded vica-<lb/>
riously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was<lb/>
there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not<lb/>
permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat<lb/>
of the cabin.</p>
<p>Every time I ascended to the deck from my<lb/>
watches below, I instantly gazed aft to mark if any<lb/>
strange face were visible; for my first vague dis-<lb/>
quietude touching the unknown captain, now in<lb/>
the seclusion of the sea, became almost a pertur-<lb/>
bation. This was strangely heightened at times<lb/>
by the ragged Elijah&#x0027;s diabolical incoherences<lb/>
uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy<lb/>
I could not have before conceived of. But poorly<lb/>
could I withstand them, much as in other moods<lb/>
I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whim-<lb/>
sicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves.<lb/>
But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or un-<lb/>
easiness&#x2014;to call it so&#x2014;which I felt, yet whenever<lb/>
I came to look about me in the ship, it seemed<lb/>
against all warranty to cherish such emotions.<lb/>
For though the harpooneers, with the great body<lb/>
of the crew, were a far more barbaric, heathenish,<lb/>
and motley set than any of the tame merchant-<lb/>
ship companies which my previous experiences<lb/>
had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed this<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n210" n="193"/>
&#x2014;and rightly ascribed it&#x2014;to the fierce uniqueness<lb/>
of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian<lb/>
vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked.<lb/>
But it was especially the aspect of the three chief<lb/>
officers of the ship&#x2014;the mates&#x2014;which was most<lb/>
forcibly calculated to allay these colourless mis-<lb/>
givings, and induce confidence and cheerfulness in<lb/>
every presentment of the voyage. Three better,<lb/>
more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own<lb/>
different way, could not readily be found, and they<lb/>
were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer,<lb/>
a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christ-<lb/>
mas when the ship shot from out her harbour, for<lb/>
a space we had biting polar weather, though all<lb/>
the time running away from it to the southward;<lb/>
and by every degree and minute of latitude which<lb/>
we sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter,<lb/>
and all its intolerable weather behind us. It was<lb/>
one of those less lowering, but still grey and<lb/>
gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when<lb/>
with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the<lb/>
water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melan-<lb/>
choly rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at<lb/>
the call of the afternoon watch, so soon as I<lb/>
levelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding<lb/>
shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension<lb/>
&#x2014;Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.</p>
<p>There seemed no sign of common bodily illness<lb/>
about him, nor of the recovery from any. He<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n211" n="194"/>
looked like a man cut away from the stake, when<lb/>
the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs<lb/>
without consuming them, or taking away one par-<lb/>
ticle from their compacted aged robustness. His<lb/>
whole high, broad form seemed made of solid<lb/>
bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like<lb/>
Cellini&#x0027;s cast of Perseus. Threading its way out from<lb/>
among his grey hairs, and continuing right down<lb/>
one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till<lb/>
it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a slender<lb/>
rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that<lb/>
perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight,<lb/>
lofty trunk of a great tree, when the upper<lb/>
lightning tearingly darts down it, and without<lb/>
wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out<lb/>
the bark from top to bottom, ere running off into<lb/>
the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but<lb/>
branded. Whether that mark was born with him,<lb/>
or whether it was the scar left by some desperate<lb/>
wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit<lb/>
consent, throughout the voyage little or no allu-<lb/>
sion was made to it, especially by the mates. But<lb/>
once Tashtego&#x0027;s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian<lb/>
among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not<lb/>
till he was full forty years old did Ahab become<lb/>
that way branded, and then it came upon him,<lb/>
not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an ele-<lb/>
mental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed<lb/>
inferentially negatived by what a grey Manxman<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n212" n="195"/>
insinuated&#x2014;an old sepulchral man, who, having<lb/>
never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never<lb/>
ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,<lb/>
the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities,<lb/>
popularly invested this old Manxman with preter-<lb/>
natural powers of discernment: so that no white<lb/>
sailor seriously contradicted him when he said<lb/>
that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly<lb/>
laid out&#x2014;which might hardly come to pass, so he<lb/>
muttered&#x2014;then, whoever should do that last office<lb/>
for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from<lb/>
crown to sole.</p>
<p>So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of<lb/>
Ahab affect me, and the livid brand which streaked<lb/>
it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted<lb/>
that not a little of this overbearing grimness was<lb/>
owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he<lb/>
partly stood. It had previously come to me that<lb/>
this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the<lb/>
polished bone of the sperm whale&#x0027;s jaw. &#x201C;Aye,<lb/>
he was dismasted off Japan,&#x201D; said the old Gay-<lb/>
Head Indian once; &#x201C;but like his dismasted craft,<lb/>
he shipped another mast without coming home<lb/>
for it. He has a quiver of &#x0027;em.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I was struck with the singular posture he main-<lb/>
tained. Upon each side of the <hi rend="i">Pequod&#x0027;s</hi> quarter-<lb/>
deck, and pretty close to the mizen shrouds, there<lb/>
was an augur-hole, bored about half an inch or so<lb/>
into the plank. His bone leg steadied in that<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n213" n="196"/>
hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud;<lb/>
Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out<lb/>
beyond the ship&#x0027;s ever-pitching prow. There was<lb/>
an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate,<lb/>
unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fear-<lb/>
less, forward dedication of that glance. Not a<lb/>
word he spoke; nor did his officers say aught to<lb/>
him; though by all their minutest gestures and<lb/>
expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if<lb/>
not painful, consciousness of being under a<lb/>
troubled master-eye. And not only that, but<lb/>
moody stricken Ahab stood before them with an<lb/>
apparently eternal anguish in his face; in all the<lb/>
nameless, regal, overbearing dignity of some<lb/>
mighty woe.</p>
<p>Ere long, from his first visit into the air, he<lb/>
withdrew into his cabin. But after that morning,<lb/>
he was every day visible to the crew; either<lb/>
standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory<lb/>
stool he had; or heavily walking the deck. As<lb/>
the sky grew less gloomy&#x2014;indeed, began to grow<lb/>
a little genial&#x2014;he became still less and less a re-<lb/>
cluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from home,<lb/>
nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea<lb/>
had then kept him so secluded. And, by-and-by,<lb/>
it came to pass, that he was almost continually in<lb/>
the air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or per-<lb/>
ceptibly did, on the, at last, sunny deck, he seemed<lb/>
as unnecessary there as another mast. But the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n214" n="197"/>
<hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> was only making a passage now; not<lb/>
regularly cruising, nearly all whaling preparatives<lb/>
needing supervision the mates were fully compe-<lb/>
tent to; so that there was little or nothing, out of<lb/>
himself, to employ or excite Ahab now, and thus<lb/>
chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that<lb/>
layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever<lb/>
all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile them-<lb/>
selves upon.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling per-<lb/>
suasiveness of the pleasant, holiday weather we<lb/>
came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his<lb/>
mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing<lb/>
girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry,<lb/>
misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest,<lb/>
most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send<lb/>
forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such<lb/>
glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a<lb/>
little respond to the playful allurings of that<lb/>
girlish air. More than once did he put forth the<lb/>
faint blossom of a look, which, in any other man,<lb/>
would have soon flowered out in a smile.</p>

<hi rend="sc">enter ahab; to him, stubb</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Some</hi> days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern,<lb/>
the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> now went rolling through the bright<lb/>
Quito spring, which, at sea, almost perpetually<lb/>
reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of<lb/>
the Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing,<lb/>
perfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as<lb/>
crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up,<lb/>
flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and<lb/>
stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled<lb/>
velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride the<lb/>
memory of their absent conquering Earls, the<lb/>
golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man, &#x0027;twas<lb/>
hard to choose between such winsome days and<lb/>
such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of<lb/>
that unwaning weather did not merely lend new<lb/>
spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward<lb/>
they turned upon the soul, especially when the<lb/>
still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory<lb/>
shot her crystals, as the clear ice most forms of<lb/>
noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies,<lb/>
more and more they wrought on Ahab&#x0027;s texture.</p>
<p>Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n216" n="199"/>
linked with life, the less man has to do with aught<lb/>
that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,<lb/>
the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths<lb/>
to visit the night-cloaked deck. It was so with<lb/>
Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much<lb/>
to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his<lb/>
visits were more to the cabin, than from the cabin<lb/>
to the planks. &#x201C;It feels like going down into<lb/>
one&#x0027;s tomb,&#x201D;&#x2014;he would mutter to himself,&#x2014;&#x201C;for<lb/>
an old captain like me to be descending this nar-<lb/>
row scuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the<lb/>
watches of the night were set, and the band on<lb/>
deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;<lb/>
and when, if a rope was to be hauled upon the<lb/>
forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as<lb/>
by day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its<lb/>
place, for fear of disturbing their slumbering ship-<lb/>
mates; when this sort of steady quietude would<lb/>
begin to prevail, habitually the silent steersman<lb/>
would watch the cabin scuttle; and ere long the<lb/>
old man would emerge, griping at the iron ban-<lb/>
ister, to help his crippled way. Some consider-<lb/>
ating touch of humanity was in him; for at times<lb/>
like these, he usually abstained from patrolling<lb/>
the quarter-deck; because to his wearied mates,<lb/>
seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel,<lb/>
such would have been the reverberating crack and<lb/>
din of that bony step, that their dreams would<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n217" n="200"/>
have been of the crunching teeth of sharks. But<lb/>
once, the mood, was on him too deep for common<lb/>
regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace<lb/>
he was measuring the ship from taffrail to main-<lb/>
mast, Stubb, the odd second mate, came up from<lb/>
below, and with a certain unassured, deprecating<lb/>
humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was<lb/>
pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say<lb/>
nay; but there might be some way of muffling<lb/>
the noise; hinting something indistinctly and<lb/>
hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the inser-<lb/>
tion into it of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou<lb/>
did&#x0027;st not know Ahab then.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,&#x201D; said Ahab,<lb/>
&#x201C;that thou wouldst wad me that fashion? But<lb/>
go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly<lb/>
grave, where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to<lb/>
use ye to the filling one at last.&#x2014;Down, dog, and<lb/>
kennel!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Starting at the unforeseen concluding exclama-<lb/>
tion of the so suddenly scornful old man, Stubb<lb/>
was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,<lb/>
&#x201C;I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir:<lb/>
I do but less than half like it, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Avast!&#x201D; gritted Ahab between his set teeth,<lb/>
and violently moving away, as if to avoid some<lb/>
passionate temptation.</p>
<p>&#x201C;No, sir; not yet,&#x201D; said Stubb, emboldened,<lb/>
&#x201C;I will not tamely be called a dog, sir.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n218" n="201"/>
<p>&#x201C;Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule,<lb/>
and an ass&#x2014;and begone, or I&#x0027;ll clear the<lb/>
world of thee!&#x201D;</p>
<p>As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with<lb/>
such overbearing terrors in his aspect, that Stubb<lb/>
involuntarily retreated.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I was never served so before without giving a<lb/>
hard blow for it,&#x201D; muttered Stubb, as he found<lb/>
himself descending the cabin-scuttle. &#x201C;It&#x0027;s very<lb/>
queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don&#x0027;t well<lb/>
know whether to go back and strike him, or&#x2014;-<lb/>
what&#x0027;s that?&#x2014;down here on my knees and pray<lb/>
for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up<lb/>
in me; but it would be the first time I ever <hi rend="i">did</hi><lb/>
pray. It&#x0027;s queer; very queer; and he&#x0027;s queer<lb/>
too; aye, take him fore and aft, he&#x0027;s about the<lb/>
queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How<lb/>
he flashed at me!&#x2014;his eyes like powder-pans!<lb/>
Is he mad? Any-way there&#x0027;s something on his<lb/>
mind, as sure as there must be something on a<lb/>
deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now,<lb/>
either, more than three hours out of the twenty-<lb/>
four; and he don&#x0027;t sleep then. Didn&#x0027;t that<lb/>
Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning<lb/>
he always finds the old man&#x0027;s hammock clothes<lb/>
all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down<lb/>
at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into<lb/>
knots, and the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as<lb/>
though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n219" n="202"/>
man! I guess he&#x0027;s got what some folks ashore<lb/>
call a conscience: it&#x0027;s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row<lb/>
they say&#x2014;worse nor a toothache. Well, well;<lb/>
I don&#x0027;t know what it is, but the Lord keep me<lb/>
from catching it. He&#x0027;s full of riddles. I wonder<lb/>
what he goes into the after-hold for, every night,<lb/>
as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects: what&#x0027;s that<lb/>
for, I should like to know? Who&#x0027;s made ap-<lb/>
pointments with him in the hold? Aint that<lb/>
queer, now? But there&#x0027;s no telling; it&#x0027;s the old<lb/>
game&#x2014;Here goes for a snooze. D&#x2014;n me, it&#x0027;s<lb/>
worth a fellow&#x0027;s while to be born into the world,<lb/>
if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think<lb/>
of it, that&#x0027;s about the first thing babies do, and<lb/>
that&#x0027;s a sort of queer, too. D&#x2014;n me, but all<lb/>
things are queer, come to think of &#x0027;em. But<lb/>
that&#x0027;s against my principles. Think not, is my<lb/>
eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can,<lb/>
is my twelfth&#x2014;So here goes again. But how&#x0027;s<lb/>
that? didn&#x0027;t he call me a dog? Blazes! he called<lb/>
me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jack-<lb/>
asses on top of <hi rend="i">that!</hi> He might as well have<lb/>
kicked me, and done with it. May-be he <hi rend="i">did</hi> kick<lb/>
me, and I didn&#x0027;t observe it, I was so taken all<lb/>
aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a<lb/>
bleached bone. What the devil&#x0027;s the matter with<lb/>
me? I don&#x0027;t stand right on my legs. Coming<lb/>
afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me<lb/>
wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n220" n="203"/>
dreaming, though. How? how? how?&#x2014;but the<lb/>
only way&#x0027;s to stash it; so here goes to hammock<lb/>
again; and in the morning, I&#x0027;ll see how this<lb/>
plaguy juggling thinks over by daylight.</p>

<hi rend="sc">the pipe</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">When</hi> Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a<lb/>
while leaning over the bulwarks; and then, as<lb/>
had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor<lb/>
of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory<lb/>
stool, and also his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the<lb/>
binnacle lamp, and planting the stool on the<lb/>
weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.</p>
<p>In old Norse times, the thrones of<lb/>
the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated, saith tradition, of<lb/>
the tusks of the narwhal. How could one look<lb/>
at Ahab, then, seated on that tripod of bones,<lb/>
without bethinking him of the royalty it symbol-<lb/>
ized? For a khan of the plank, and a king of<lb/>
the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.</p>
<p>Some moments passed, during which the thick<lb/>
vapour came from his mouth in quick and con-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n221" n="204"/>
stant puffs, which blew back again into his face.<lb/>
&#x201C;How now,&#x201D; he soliloquized at last, withdrawing<lb/>
the tube; &#x201C;this smoking no longer soothes. Oh,<lb/>
my pipe! hard must it go with me, if thy charm<lb/>
be gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling,<lb/>
not pleasuring,&#x2014;aye, and ignorantly smoking to<lb/>
windward all the while; to windward, and with<lb/>
such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale,<lb/>
my final jets were the strongest and fullest of<lb/>
trouble. What business have I with this pipe?<lb/>
This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send<lb/>
up mild white vapours among mild white hairs,<lb/>
not among torn iron gray locks like mine. I&#x0027;ll<lb/>
smoke no more&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea.<lb/>
The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant<lb/>
the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe<lb/>
made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced<lb/>
the planks.</p>

<p><hi rend="sc">Next</hi> morning Stubb accosted Flask.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had.<lb/>
You know the old man&#x0027;s ivory leg? Well, I<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n222" n="205"/>
dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried<lb/>
to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I<lb/>
kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab<lb/>
seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept<lb/>
kicking at it. But what was still more curious,<lb/>
Flask,&#x2014;you know how curious all dreams are&#x2014;-<lb/>
through all this rage that I was in, I somehow<lb/>
seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it<lb/>
was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab.<lb/>
&#x2018;Why,&#x2019; thinks I, &#x2018;what&#x0027;s the row? It&#x0027;s not a<lb/>
real leg, only a false leg.&#x2019; And there&#x0027;s a mighty<lb/>
difference between a living thump and a dead<lb/>
thump. That&#x0027;s what makes a blow from the hand,<lb/>
Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow<lb/>
from a cane. The living member&#x2014;that makes<lb/>
the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to<lb/>
myself, all the while, mind, while I was stubbing<lb/>
my silly toes against that cursed pyramid&#x2014;so<lb/>
confoundedly contradictory was it all,&#x2014;-all the<lb/>
while, I say, I was thinking to myself, &#x2018;what&#x0027;s<lb/>
his leg now, but a cane&#x2014;a whalebone cane? Yes,&#x2019;<lb/>
thinks I, &#x2018;it was only a playful cudgelling&#x2014;in<lb/>
fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me&#x2014;not a<lb/>
base kick. Besides,&#x2019; thinks I, &#x2018;look at it once;<lb/>
why, the end of it&#x2014;the foot part&#x2014;what a small<lb/>
sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad-footed farmer<lb/>
kicked me, <hi rend="i">there&#x0027;s</hi> a devilish broad insult. But<lb/>
this insult is whittled down to a point only.&#x0027; But<lb/>
now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n223" n="206"/>
While I was battering away at the pyramid, a<lb/>
sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump<lb/>
on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews<lb/>
me round. &#x2018;What are you &#x2018;bout?&#x2019; says he. Slid!<lb/>
man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But,<lb/>
somehow, next moment I was over the fright.<lb/>
&#x2018;What am I about?&#x2019; says I at last. &#x2018;And what<lb/>
business is that of yours, I should like to know,<lb/>
Mr. Humpback? Do <hi rend="i">you</hi> want a kick?&#x2019; By the<lb/>
Lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he<lb/>
turned round his stern to me, bent over, and<lb/>
dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout&#x2014;-<lb/>
what do you think I saw?&#x2014;why, thunder alive,<lb/>
man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with<lb/>
the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, &#x2018;I<lb/>
guess I won&#x0027;t kick you, old fellow.&#x2019; &#x2018;Wise Stubb,&#x2019;<lb/>
said he, &#x2018;wise Stubb;&#x2019; and kept muttering it all<lb/>
the time, a sort of eating his own gums like a<lb/>
chimney hag. Seeing he wasn&#x0027;t going to stop<lb/>
saying over his &#x2018;wise Stubb, wise Stubb,&#x2019; I<lb/>
thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyra-<lb/>
mid again. But I had only just lifted my foot<lb/>
for it, when he roared out, &#x2018;Stop that kicking!&#x2019;<lb/>
&#x2018;Halloa,&#x2019; says I, &#x2018;what&#x0027;s the matter now, old<lb/>
fellow?&#x2019; Look ye here,&#x0027; says he; &#x2018;let&#x0027;s argue the<lb/>
insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, did&#x0027;nt he?&#x2019;<lb/>
&#x2018;Yes, he did,&#x2019; says I; &#x2018;right <hi rend="i">here</hi> it was.&#x2019; &#x2018;Very<lb/>
good,&#x2019; says he; &#x2018;he used his ivory leg, didn&#x0027;t he?&#x2019;<lb/>
&#x2018;Yes, he did,&#x2019; says I. &#x2018;Well then,&#x2019; says he, &#x2018;wise<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n224" n="207"/>
Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn&#x0027;t<lb/>
he kick with right good will? it wasn&#x0027;t a common<lb/>
pitch-pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you<lb/>
were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful<lb/>
ivory leg, Stubb. It&#x0027;s an honour; I consider it<lb/>
an honour. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England<lb/>
the greatest lords think it great glory to be<lb/>
slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of;<lb/>
but, be <hi rend="i">your</hi> boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by<lb/>
old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember<lb/>
what I say: <hi rend="i">be</hi> kicked by him; account his kicks<lb/>
honours; and on no account kick back; for you<lb/>
can&#x0027;t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don&#x0027;t you see<lb/>
that pyramid?&#x2019; With that, he all of a sudden<lb/>
seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim<lb/>
off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there<lb/>
I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think<lb/>
of that dream, Flask?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x0027;t know; it seems a sort of foolish to<lb/>
me, though.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;May be; may be. But it&#x0027;s made a wise man<lb/>
of me, Flask. D&#x0027;ye see Ahab standing there,<lb/>
sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best<lb/>
thing you can do, Flask, is to let that old man<lb/>
alone: never speak quick to him, whatever he<lb/>
says. Halloa! what&#x0027;s that he shouts? Hark!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye!<lb/>
There are whales hereabouts! If ye see a white<lb/>
one, split your lungs for him!&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n225" n="208"/>
<p>&#x201C;What d&#x0027;ye think of that now, Flask? Ain&#x0027;t<lb/>
there a small drop of something queer about that,<lb/>
eh? A white whale&#x2014;did ye mark that, man?<lb/>
Look ye&#x2014;there&#x0027;s something special in the wind.<lb/>
Stand by for it, Flask. Ahab has that that&#x0027;s<lb/>
bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this<lb/>

John Hunter, and Lesson, those lights of zoology<lb/>
and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real know-<lb/>
ledge there be little, yet of books there are a<lb/>
plenty; and so in some small degree, with ceto-<lb/>
logy, or the science of whales. Many are the<lb/>
men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and<lb/>
seamen, who have at large or in little, written of<lb/>
the whale. Run over a few:&#x2014;The Authors of the<lb/>
Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas<lb/>
Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linn&#x00E6;us; Rondeletius;<lb/>
Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;<lb/>
Marten; Lac&#x00E9;p&#x00E8;de; Bonneterre; Desmarest;<lb/>
Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier; John Hunter;<lb/>
Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross<lb/>
Browne; the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olm-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n227" n="210"/>
stead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what<lb/>
ultimate generalizing purpose all these have writ-<lb/>
ten, the above cited extracts will show.</p>
<p>Of the names in this list of whale authors, only<lb/>
those following Owen ever saw living whales; and<lb/>
but one of them was a real professional harpooneer<lb/>
and whaleman&#x2014;I mean Captain Scoresby. On<lb/>
the separate subject of the Greenland or right-<lb/>
whale, he is the best existing authority. But<lb/>
Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the<lb/>
great sperm whale, compared with which the<lb/>
Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning.<lb/>
And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is<lb/>
an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is<lb/>
not even by any means the largest of the whales.<lb/>
Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and<lb/>
the profound ignorance which, till some seventy<lb/>
years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly<lb/>
unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to<lb/>
this present day still reigns in all but some few<lb/>
scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation<lb/>
has been every way complete. Reference to nearly<lb/>
all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of<lb/>
past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland<lb/>
whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch<lb/>
of the seas. But the time has at last come for a<lb/>
new proclamation. This is Charing Cross: hear<lb/>
ye! good people all,&#x2014;the Greenland whale is de-<lb/>
posed,&#x2014;the great sperm whale now reigneth!</p>
<pb xml:id="n228" n="211"/>
<p>There are only two books in being which at all<lb/>
pretend to put the living sperm whale before you,<lb/>
and at the same time, in the remotest degree suc-<lb/>
ceed in the attempt. Those books are Beale&#x0027;s<lb/>
and Bennett&#x0027;s; both in their time surgeons to<lb/>
English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact<lb/>
and reliable men. The original matter touching<lb/>
the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is<lb/>
necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of<lb/>
excellent quality, though mostly confined to scien-<lb/>
tific description. As yet, however, the sperm<lb/>
whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in<lb/>
any literature. Far above all other hunted whales,<lb/>
his is an unwritten life.</p>
<p>Now the various species of whales need some<lb/>
sort of popular comprehensive classification, if<lb/>
only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter<lb/>
to be filled in all its departments by subsequent<lb/>
labourers. As no better man advances to take<lb/>
this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own<lb/>
poor endeavours. I promise nothing complete;<lb/>
because any human thing supposed to be complete,<lb/>
must for that very reason infallibly be faulty. I<lb/>
shall not pretend to a minute anatomical descrip-<lb/>
tion of the various species, or&#x2014;in this place at<lb/>
least&#x2014;to much of any systematization of cetology.<lb/>
I am the architect, not the builder.</p>
<p>But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-<lb/>
sorter in the Post-office is equal to it. To grope<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n229" n="212"/>
down into the bottom of the sea after them; to<lb/>
have one&#x0027;s hands among the unspeakable founda-<lb/>
tions, ribs, and very pelvis of the world&#x2014;this is a<lb/>
fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to<lb/>
hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful taunt-<lb/>
ings in Job might well appal me. &#x201C;Will he&#x201D;<lb/>
(the leviathan) &#x201C;make a covenant with thee?<lb/>
Behold the hope of him is vain!&#x201D; But I have<lb/>
swum through libraries, and sailed through<lb/>
oceans; I have had to do with whales with these<lb/>
visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try.<lb/>
There are some preliminaries to settle.</p>
<p>First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of<lb/>
this science of Cetology is in the very vestibule<lb/>
attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still<lb/>
remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish.<lb/>
In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776, Linn&#x00E6;us<lb/>
declares, &#x201C;I hereby separate the whales from the<lb/>
fish.&#x201D; But of my own knowledge, I know that<lb/>
down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives<lb/>
and herring, against Linn&#x00E6;us&#x0027;s express edict, were<lb/>
still found dividing the possession of the same<lb/>
seas with the Leviathan.</p>
<p>The grounds upon which Linn&#x00E6;us would fain<lb/>
have banished the whales from the waters, he<lb/>
states as follows: &#x201C;On account of their warm<lb/>
bilocular heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids,<lb/>
their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mam-<lb/>
mis lactantem,&#x201D; and finally, &#x201C;ex lege natur&#x00E6; jure<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n230" n="213"/>
meritoque.&#x201D; I submitted all this to my friends<lb/>
Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket,<lb/>
both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and<lb/>
they united in the opinion that the reasons set<lb/>
forth were altogether insufficient. Charley pro-<lb/>
fanely hinted they were humbug.</p>
<p>Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take<lb/>
the good old-fashioned ground that the whale is a<lb/>
fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This<lb/>
fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in<lb/>
what internal respect does the whale differ from<lb/>
other fish. Above, Linn&#x00E6;us has given you those<lb/>
items. But in brief, they are; these; lungs and<lb/>
warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless<lb/>
and cold-blooded.</p>
<p>Next: how shall we define the whale, by his<lb/>
obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him<lb/>
for all time to come? To be short, then: a whale<lb/>
is <hi rend="i">a spouting fish with a horizontal tail</hi>. There you<lb/>
have him. However contracted, that definition is<lb/>
the result of expanded meditation. A walrus<lb/>
spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a<lb/>
fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term<lb/>
of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled<lb/>
with the first. Almost any one must have noticed<lb/>
that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a<lb/>
flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas,<lb/>
among spouting fish the tail, though it may be<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n231" n="214"/>
similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal<lb/>
position.</p>
<p>By the above definition of what a whale is, I do<lb/>
by no means exclude from the leviathanic brother-<lb/>
hood any sea creature hitherto identified with the<lb/>
whale by the best informed Nantucketera; nor, on<lb/>
the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto<lb/>
authoritatively regarded as alien.<note xml:id="fn2-214"><p>I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled<lb/>
Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of<lb/>
Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales.<lb/>
But as these pig-fish are a nosy, contemptible set, mostly lurking<lb/>
in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially<lb/>
as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales, and have<lb/>
presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of<lb/>
Cetology.</p></note> Hence, all<lb/>
the smaller, spouting, and horizontal-tailed fish<lb/>
must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.<lb/>
Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire<lb/>
whale host.</p>
<p>First: According to magnitude I divide the<lb/>
whales into three primary BOOKS (subdivisible<lb/>
into <hi rend="sc">Chapters</hi>), and these shall comprehend them<lb/>
all, both small and large.</p>
<p>I. The <hi rend="sc">Folio Whale</hi>; II. the <hi rend="sc">Octavo Whale</hi>;<lb/>
III. the <hi rend="sc">Duodecimo Whale.</hi></p>
<p>As the type of the <hi rend="sc">Folio</hi> I present the <hi rend="i">Sperm<lb/>
Whale</hi>; of the <hi rend="sc">Octavo</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Grampus</hi>; of the<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">Duodecimo</hi>, the <hi rend="i">Porpoise</hi>.</p>
<pb xml:id="n232" n="215"/>
<p>FOLIOS. Among these I here include the fol-<lb/>
lowing chapters:&#x2014;I. The <hi rend="i">Sperm Whale</hi>; II. the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Right Whale</hi>; III. the <hi rend="i">Fin Back Whale</hi>: IV. the<lb/>
<hi rend="i">Hump-backed Whale</hi>; V. the <hi rend="i">Razor Back Whale</hi>;<lb/>
VI. the <hi rend="i">Sulphur Bottom Whale</hi>.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> I. (<hi rend="i">Sperm Whale</hi>.)<lb/>
&#x2014;This whale, among the English of old vaguely<lb/>
known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter<lb/>
whale, and the Anvil-Headed whale, is the present<lb/>
Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the<lb/>
Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long<lb/>
Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inha-<lb/>
bitant of the globe; the most formidable of all<lb/>
whales to encounter; the most majestic in aspect;<lb/>
and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce;<lb/>
he being the only creature from which that valu-<lb/>
able substance, spermaceti, is obtained. All his<lb/>
peculiarities will, in many other places, be en-<lb/>
larged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I<lb/>
now have to do. Philologically considered, it is<lb/>
absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm<lb/>
whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper<lb/>
individuality, and when his oil was only accident-<lb/>
ally obtained from the stranded fish; in those<lb/>
days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly<lb/>
supposed to be derived from a creature identical<lb/>
with the one then known in England as the Green-<lb/>
land or Right whale. It was the idea also, that<lb/>
this same spermaceti was that quickening humour<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n233" n="216"/>
of the Greenland whale which the first syllable of<lb/>
the word literally expresses. In those times, also,<lb/>
spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used<lb/>
for light, but only as an ointment and medica-<lb/>
ment. It was only to be had from the druggists, as<lb/>
you now-a-days buy an ounce of rhubarb. When,<lb/>
as I opine, in the course of time, the true nature<lb/>
of spermaceti became known, its original name<lb/>
was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to<lb/>
enhance its value by a notion so strangely signify-<lb/>
cant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must<lb/>
at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale<lb/>
from which this spermaceti was really derived.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> II. (<hi rend="i">Right Whale</hi>).&#x2014;-<lb/>
In one respect this is the most venerable of the<lb/>
leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by<lb/>
man. It yields the article commonly known as<lb/>
whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known<lb/>
as &#x201C;whale oil,&#x201D; an inferior article in commerce.<lb/>
Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately de-<lb/>
signated by all the following titles: The Whale;<lb/>
the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the<lb/>
Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale.<lb/>
There is a deal of obscurity concerning the iden-<lb/>
tity of the species thus multitudinously baptized.<lb/>
What then is the whale, which I include in the<lb/>
second species of my Folios? It is the Great<lb/>
Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the Green-<lb/>
land Whale of the English whalemen; the Baleine<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n234" n="217"/>
Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands<lb/>
Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for<lb/>
more than two centuries past has been hunted by<lb/>
the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the<lb/>
whale which the American fishermen have long<lb/>
pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks,<lb/>
on the Nor&#x0027; West Coast, and various other parts<lb/>
of the world, designated by them Right Whale<lb/>
Cruising Grounds.</p>
<p>Some pretend to see a difference between the<lb/>
Greenland whale of the English and the right<lb/>
whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree<lb/>
in all their grand features; nor has there yet been<lb/>
presented a single determinate fact upon which<lb/>
to ground a radical distinction. It is by endless<lb/>
subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive<lb/>
differences, that some departments of natural his-<lb/>
tory become so repellingly intricate. The right<lb/>
whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length,<lb/>
with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> III. (<hi rend="i">Fin-Back</hi>).&#x2014;-<lb/>
Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the<lb/>
various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-<lb/>
John, has been seen almost in every sea, and is<lb/>
commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often<lb/>
descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in<lb/>
the New York packet-tracks. In the length he<lb/>
attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles<lb/>
the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n235" n="218"/>
a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great<lb/>
lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the<lb/>
intertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles.<lb/>
His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from<lb/>
which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous<lb/>
object. This fin is some three or four feet long,<lb/>
growing vertically from the hinder part of the<lb/>
back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp<lb/>
pointed end. Even if not the slightest other part<lb/>
of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will, at<lb/>
times, be seen plainly projecting from the sur-<lb/>
face. When the sea is moderately calm, and<lb/>
slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this<lb/>
gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon<lb/>
the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that<lb/>
the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resem-<lb/>
bles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines<lb/>
graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often<lb/>
goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He<lb/>
seems a whale-hater, as some men are men-haters.<lb/>
Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly<lb/>
rising to the surface in the remotest and most<lb/>
sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet<lb/>
rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren<lb/>
plain; gifted with such wondrous power and<lb/>
velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pur-<lb/>
suit from man&#x2014;this leviathan seems the banished<lb/>
and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for<lb/>
his mark that style upon his back. From having<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n236" n="219"/>
the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is some-<lb/>
times included with the right whale, among a<lb/>
theoretic species denominated <hi rend="i">Whalebone whales</hi>;<lb/>
that is, whales with baleen. Of these so-called<lb/>
Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several<lb/>
varieties, most of which, however, are little known.<lb/>
Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-<lb/>
headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed<lb/>
whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen&#x0027;s<lb/>
names for a few sorts.</p>
<p>In connexion with this appellative of &#x201C;Whale-<lb/>
bone whales,&#x201D; it is of great importance to men-<lb/>
tion, that however such a nomenclature may be<lb/>
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind<lb/>
of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear clas-<lb/>
sification of the Leviathan, founded upon either<lb/>
his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwith-<lb/>
standing that those marked parts or features very<lb/>
obviously seem better adapted to afforded the<lb/>
bases for a regular system of Cetology than any<lb/>
other detached bodily distinctions, which the<lb/>
whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The<lb/>
baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are<lb/>
things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately<lb/>
dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any<lb/>
regard to what may be the nature of their struc-<lb/>
ture in other and more essential particulars.<lb/>
Thus, the sperm whale and the Humpbacked<lb/>
whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n237" n="220"/>
ceases. Then this same Humpbacked whale and<lb/>
the Greenland whale, each has baleen; but there<lb/>
again the similitude ceases. And it is just the<lb/>
same with the other parts above mentioned. In<lb/>
various sorts of whales, they form such irregular<lb/>
combinations, or, in the case of any one of them<lb/>
detached, such an irregular isolation, as utterly<lb/>
to defy all general methodization formed upon<lb/>
such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-<lb/>
naturalists have split.</p>
<p>But it may possibly be conceived that, in the<lb/>
internal parts of the whale, in his anatomy&#x2014;there,<lb/>
at least, we shall be able to hit the right classify-<lb/>
cation. Nay; what thing, for example, is there<lb/>
in the Greenland whale&#x0027;s anatomy more striking<lb/>
than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by his<lb/>
baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the<lb/>
Greenland whale. And if you descend into the<lb/>
bowels of the various leviathans, why, there you<lb/>
will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available<lb/>
to the systematiaer as those external ones already<lb/>
enumerated. What then remains? nothing but<lb/>
to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire<lb/>
liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.<lb/>
And this is the bibliographical system here<lb/>
adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly<lb/>
succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter iv</hi>. (<hi rend="i">Hump Back</hi>).<lb/>
&#x2014;This whale is often seen on the northern Ame-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n238" n="221"/>
rican coast. He has been frequently captured<lb/>
there, and towed into harbour. He has a great<lb/>
pack on him like a pedlar; or you might call him<lb/>
the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the<lb/>
popular name for him does not sufficiently dis-<lb/>
tinguish him, since the sperm whale also has a<lb/>
hump, though a smaller one. His oil is not very<lb/>
valuable. He has baleen. He is the most game-<lb/>
some and light-hearted of all the whales, making<lb/>
more gay foam and white water generally than<lb/>
any other of them.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter v</hi>. (<hi rend="i">Razor Back</hi>).<lb/>
&#x2014;Of this whale little is known but his name. I<lb/>
have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of<lb/>
a retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and<lb/>
philosophers. Though no coward, he has never<lb/>
yet shown any part of him but his back, which<lb/>
rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know<lb/>
little more of him, nor does anybody else.</p>
<p>BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter vi.</hi> (<hi rend="i">Sulphur Bottom</hi>).<lb/>
&#x2014;Another retiring gentleman, with a brimstone<lb/>
belly, doubtless got by scraping along the Tar-<lb/>
tarean tiles in some of his profounder divings.<lb/>
He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen<lb/>
him except in the remoter southern seas, and<lb/>
then always at too great a distance to study his<lb/>
countenance. He is never chased; he would run<lb/>
away with rope walks of line. Prodigies are told<lb/>
of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say no-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n239" n="222"/>
thing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest<lb/>
Nantucketer.</p>
<p>Thus ends BOOK I. (<hi rend="i">Folio</hi>), and now begins<lb/>
BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>).</p>
<p>OCTAVOS.<note xml:id="fn3-222"><p>Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is<lb/>
very plain. Because, while the whales of this order, though<lb/>
smaller than those of the former order, nevertheless retain a<lb/>
proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the bookbinder&#x0027;s<lb/>
Quarto volume in its diminished form does not preserve the<lb/>
shape of the Folio volume, but the octavo volume does.</p></note><lb/>
These embrace the whales of<lb/>
middling magnitude, among which at present may<lb/>
be numbered:&#x2014;I. the <hi rend="i">Grampus</hi>; II. the <hi rend="i">Black<lb/>
Fish</hi>; III. the <hi rend="i">Narwhal</hi>; IV. the <hi rend="i">Thrasher</hi>;<lb/>
V. the <hi rend="i">Killer</hi>.</p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter I</hi> (<hi rend="i">Grampus</hi>).&#x2014;-<lb/>
Though this fish, whose loud sonorous breathing,<lb/>
or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to<lb/>
landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep,<lb/>
yet is he not popularly classed among whales;<lb/>
but possessing all the grand distinctive features<lb/>
of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised<lb/>
him for one. He is of moderate octavo size,<lb/>
varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length,<lb/>
and of corresponding dimensions round the waist.<lb/>
He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted,<lb/>
though his oil is considerable in quantity, and<lb/>
pretty good for light. By some fishermen his<lb/>
approach is regarded as premonitory of the ad-<lb/>
vance of the great sperm whale.</p>
<pb xml:id="n240" n="223"/>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter II</hi>. (<hi rend="i">Black Fish</hi>).<lb/>
I give the popular fishermen&#x0027;s names for all these<lb/>
fish, for generally they are the best. Where any<lb/>
name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall<lb/>
say so, and suggest another. I do so now, touch-<lb/>
ing the Black Fish, so called, because blackness is<lb/>
the rule among almost all whales. So, call him<lb/>
the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity<lb/>
is well known, and from the circumstance that<lb/>
the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards,<lb/>
he carries an everlasting Mephistophilean grin on<lb/>
his face. This whale averages some sixteen or<lb/>
eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost<lb/>
all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing<lb/>
his dorsal hooked fin in swimming, which looks<lb/>
something like a Roman nose. When not more<lb/>
profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters<lb/>
sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up<lb/>
the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment;<lb/>
as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of<lb/>
company, and quite alone by themselves, burn<lb/>
unsavoury tallow instead of odorous wax. Though<lb/>
their blubber is very thin, some of these whales<lb/>
will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.</p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter III</hi>. (<hi rend="i">Narwhal</hi>,<lb/>
that is, <hi rend="i">Nostril whale</hi>.)&#x2014;Another instance of a cu-<lb/>
riously named whale, so named I suppose from his<lb/>
peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked<lb/>
nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n241" n="224"/>
while its horn averages five feet, though some ex-<lb/>
ceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly<lb/>
speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, grow-<lb/>
ing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed<lb/>
from the horizontal. But it is only found on the<lb/>
sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner<lb/>
something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy<lb/>
left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory<lb/>
horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It<lb/>
does not seem to be used like the blade of the<lb/>
sword-fish and the bill-fish; though some sailors<lb/>
tell me that the Narwhal employs it for a rake in<lb/>
turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley<lb/>
Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the<lb/>
Narwhal, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea,<lb/>
and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up,<lb/>
and so breaks through. But you cannot prove<lb/>
either of these surmises to be correct. My own<lb/>
opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may<lb/>
really be used by the Narwhal&#x2014;however that may<lb/>
be&#x2014;it would certainly be very convenient to him<lb/>
for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhal<lb/>
I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned<lb/>
whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a<lb/>
curious example of the Unicornism to be found in<lb/>
almost every kingdom of animated nature. From<lb/>
certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that<lb/>
this same sea-unicorn&#x0027;s horn was in ancient days<lb/>
regarded as the great antidote against poison, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n242" n="225"/>
as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.<lb/>
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting<lb/>
ladies, the same way that the horns of the male<lb/>
deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally<lb/>
it was in itself accounted an object of great curi-<lb/>
osity. Black letter tells me that Sir Martin Fro-<lb/>
bisher on his return from that voyage, when Queen<lb/>
Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him<lb/>
from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his old ship<lb/>
sailed down the Thames; &#x201C;when Sir Martin re-<lb/>
turned from that voyage,&#x201D; saith Black Letter, &#x201C;on<lb/>
bended knees he presented to her highness a pro-<lb/>
digious long horn of the Narwhal, which for a<lb/>
long period after hung at the castle at Windsor.&#x201D;<lb/>
An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester,<lb/>
on bended knees, did likewise present to her high-<lb/>
ness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the<lb/>
unicorn nature.</p>
<p>The Narwhal has a very picturesque, leopard-<lb/>
like look, being of a milk-white ground colour,<lb/>
dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His<lb/>
oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is<lb/>
little of it, and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly<lb/>
found in the circumpolar seas.</p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> IV. (<hi rend="i">Killer.</hi>)&#x2014;Of<lb/>
this whale little is precisely known to the Nan-<lb/>
tucketer, and nothing at all to the professed natu-<lb/>
ralist. From what I have seen of him at a distance,<lb/>
I should say that he was about the bigness of a<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n243" n="226"/>
grampus. He is very savage&#x2014;a sort of Feejee<lb/>
fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales<lb/>
by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the<lb/>
mighty brute is worried to death. The Killer is<lb/>
never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he<lb/>
has. Exception might be taken to the name be-<lb/>
stowed upon this whale, on the ground of its indis-<lb/>
tinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on<lb/>
sea; Buonapartes and sharks included.</p>
<p>BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> V. (<hi rend="i">Thrasher</hi>).&#x2014;-<lb/>
This gentleman is famous for his tail, which he uses<lb/>
for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the<lb/>
Folio whale&#x0027;s back, and as he swims, he works his<lb/>
passage by flogging him; as some schoolmasters<lb/>
get along in the world by a similar process. Still<lb/>
less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer.<lb/>
Both are outlaws, even in lawless seas.</p>
<p>Thus ends BOOK II. (<hi rend="i">Octavo</hi>), and begins<lb/>
BOOK III. (<hi rend="i">Duodecimo.</hi>)</p>
<p>DUODECIMOS.&#x2014;These include the smaller<lb/>
whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise. II. The Algerine<lb/>
Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.</p>
<p>To those who have not chanced specially to<lb/>
study the subject, it may possibly seem strange,<lb/>
that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet<lb/>
should be marshalled among WHALES&#x2014;a word<lb/>
which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea<lb/>
of hugeness. But the creatures set down above as<lb/>
Duodecimos are infallibly whales, by the terms of<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n244" n="227"/>
my definition of what a whale is&#x2014;<hi rend="i">i. e.</hi> a spouting<lb/>
fish, with a horizontal tail.</p>
<p>BOOK III. (<hi rend="i">Duodecimo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> I. (<hi rend="i">Huzza<lb/>
Porpoise</hi>).&#x2014;This is the common porpoise found<lb/>
almost all over the globe. The name is of my<lb/>
own bestowal; for there are more than one sort<lb/>
of porpoises, and something must be done to dis-<lb/>
tinguish them. I call him thus, because he always<lb/>
swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad<lb/>
sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in<lb/>
a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is<lb/>
generally hailed with delight by the mariner.<lb/>
Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the<lb/>
breezy billows to windward. They are the lads<lb/>
that always live before the wind. They are ac-<lb/>
counted a lucky omen. If you yourself can with-<lb/>
stand three cheers at beholding these vivacious<lb/>
fish, then heaven help ye: the spirit of godly<lb/>
gamesomness is not in ye. A well-fed plump<lb/>
Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of<lb/>
good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid extracted<lb/>
from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in<lb/>
request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors<lb/>
put it on their hones. Porpoise meat is good<lb/>
eating, you know. It may never have occurred<lb/>
to you that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout<lb/>
is so small that it is not very readily discernible.<lb/>
But the next time you have a chance, watch him;<lb/>
and you will then see the great sperm whale him-<lb/>
self in miniature.</p>
<pb xml:id="n245" n="228"/>
<p>BOOK III. (<hi rend="i">Duodecimo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> II. (<hi rend="i">Alge-<lb/>
rine Porpoise</hi>). A pirate. Very savage. He is<lb/>
only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is some-<lb/>
what larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much<lb/>
of the same general make. Provoke him, and<lb/>
he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered<lb/>
for him many times, but never yet saw him<lb/>
captured.</p>
<p>BOOK III. (<hi rend="i">Duodecimo</hi>), <hi rend="sc">Chapter</hi> III. (<hi rend="i">Mealy-<lb/>
mouthed Porpoise</hi>).&#x2014;The largest kind of Porpoise;<lb/>
and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is known.<lb/>
The only English name, by which he has hitherto<lb/>
been designated, is that of the fishers&#x2014;Right-<lb/>
Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is<lb/>
chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In<lb/>
shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza<lb/>
Porpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth;<lb/>
indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like<lb/>
figure. He has no fins on his back (most other<lb/>
porpoises have), he has a lovely tail, and senti-<lb/>
mental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his mealy-<lb/>
mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down<lb/>
to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary<lb/>
line, distinct as the mark in a ship&#x0027;s hull, called<lb/>
the &#x201C;bright waist&#x201D;&#x2014;that line streaks him from<lb/>
stem to stern, with two separate colours, black<lb/>
above and white below. The white comprises<lb/>
part of his head, and the whole of his mouth,<lb/>
which makes him look as if he had just escaped<lb/>
from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n246" n="229"/>
mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like<lb/>
that of the common porpoise.</p>
<p>&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x002A;</p>
<p>Beyond the <hi rend="sc">Duodecimo</hi>, this system does not<lb/>
proceed, inasmuch as the Porpoise is the smallest<lb/>
of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans<lb/>
of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain,<lb/>
fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an Ame-<lb/>
rican whaleman, I know by reputation, but not<lb/>
personally. I shall enumerate them by their<lb/>
forecastle appellations; for possibly such a list<lb/>
may be valuable to future investigators, who may<lb/>
complete what I have here but begun. If any of<lb/>
the following whales shall hereafter be caught and<lb/>
marked, then he can readily be incorporated into<lb/>
this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or<lb/>
Duodecimo magnitude:&#x2014;The Bottle-Nose Whale;<lb/>
the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale;<lb/>
the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Can-<lb/>
non Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered<lb/>
Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale;<lb/>
the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; &#x0026;c. From<lb/>
Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities,<lb/>
there might be quoted other lists of uncertain<lb/>
whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth<lb/>
names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete;<lb/>
and can hardly help suspecting them for mere<lb/>
sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying<lb/>
nothing.</p>
<pb xml:id="n247" n="230"/>
<p>Finally; It was stated at the outset, that this<lb/>
system would not be here, and at once, perfected.<lb/>
You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my<lb/>
word. But I now leave my cetological system<lb/>
standing thus unfinished, even as the great Cathe-<lb/>
dral of Cologne was left, with the crane still<lb/>
standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower.<lb/>
For small erections may be finished by their first<lb/>
architects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the<lb/>
copestone to posterity. Heaven keep me from<lb/>
ever completing anything. This whole book is<lb/>
but a draught&#x2014;nay, but the draught of a draught.<lb/>
Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the specksynder</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">Concerning</hi> the officers of the whale-craft, this<lb/>
seems as good a place as any to set down a little<lb/>
domestic peculiarity on shipboard, arising from<lb/>
the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a<lb/>
class unknown of course in any other marine than<lb/>
the whale-fleet.</p>
<p>The large importance attached to the harpooneer&#x0027;s<lb/>
vocation is evinced by the fact, that originally in<lb/>
the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n248" n="231"/>
ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly<lb/>
lodged in the person now called the captain, but<lb/>
was divided between him and an officer called the<lb/>
Specksynder. Literally this word means Fat-<lb/>
Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent<lb/>
to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain&#x0027;s<lb/>
authority was restricted to the navigation and<lb/>
general management of the vessel; while over the<lb/>
whale-hunting department and all its concerns,<lb/>
the Specksynder or Chief Harpooneer reigned<lb/>
supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery,<lb/>
under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this<lb/>
old Dutch official is still retained, but his former<lb/>
dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks<lb/>
simply as senior Harpooneer, and as such, is but<lb/>
one of the captain&#x0027;s more inferior subalterns.<lb/>
Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the<lb/>
harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely<lb/>
depends; and since in the American Fishery he<lb/>
is not only an important officer in the boat, but<lb/>
under certain circumstances (night-watches on a<lb/>
whaling ground) the command of the ship&#x0027;s deck<lb/>
is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of<lb/>
the sea demands, that he should nominally live<lb/>
apart from the men before the mast, and be in<lb/>
some way distinguished as their professional<lb/>
superior; though always, by them, familiarly re-<lb/>
garded as their social equal.</p>
<p>Now, one of the grand distinctions drawn be-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n249" n="232"/>
tween officer and man at sea, is this&#x2014;the first<lb/>
lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships<lb/>
and merchantmen alike, the mates have their<lb/>
quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of<lb/>
the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged<lb/>
in the after part of the ship. That is to say, they<lb/>
take their meals in the captain&#x0027;s cabin, and sleep<lb/>
in a place indirectly communicating with it.</p>
<p>Though the long period of a Southern whaling<lb/>
voyage (by far the longest of all voyages now or<lb/>
ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and<lb/>
the community of interest prevailing among a<lb/>
company, all of whom, high or low, depend for<lb/>
their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their<lb/>
common luck, together with their common vigi-<lb/>
lance, intrepidity, and hard work&#x2014;though all<lb/>
these things do in some cases tend to beget a less<lb/>
rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally;<lb/>
yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopota-<lb/>
mian family these whalemen may, in some primi-<lb/>
tive instances, live together; for all that, the<lb/>
punctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck<lb/>
are seldom materially relaxed, and in no instance<lb/>
done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket<lb/>
ships in which you will see the skipper parading<lb/>
his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not sur-<lb/>
passed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost<lb/>
as much outward homage as if he wore the impe-<lb/>
rial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth.</p>
<pb xml:id="n250" n="233"/>
<p>And though of all men the moody captain of<lb/>
the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> was the least given to that sort of<lb/>
shallowest assumption; and though the only ho-<lb/>
mage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous<lb/>
obedience; though he required no man to remove<lb/>
the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the<lb/>
quarter-deck; and though there were times when,<lb/>
owing to peculiar circumstances connected with<lb/>
events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them<lb/>
in unusual terms, whether of condescension, or <hi rend="i">in<lb/>
terrorem</hi>, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab<lb/>
was by no means unobservant of the paramount<lb/>
forms and usages of the sea.</p>
<p>Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually per-<lb/>
ceived, that behind those forms and usages, as it<lb/>
were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally<lb/>
making use of them for other and more private<lb/>
ends than they were legitimately intended to sub-<lb/>
serve. That certain sultanism of his brain, which<lb/>
had otherwise in a good degree remained unmani-<lb/>
fested&#x2014;through those forms that same sultanism<lb/>
became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.<lb/>
For be a man&#x0027;s intellectual superiority what it will,<lb/>
it can never assume the practical, available supre-<lb/>
macy over other men, without the aid of some<lb/>
sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in<lb/>
themselves, more or less paltry and base. This<lb/>
it is, that for ever keeps God&#x0027;s true princes of the<lb/>
Empire from the world&#x0027;s hustings; and leaves the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n251" n="234"/>
highest honour that this air can give, to those<lb/>
men who become famous, more through their infi-<lb/>
nite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the<lb/>
Divine Inert, than through their undoubted supe-<lb/>
riority over the dead level of the mass. Such<lb/>
large virtue lurks in these small things when<lb/>
extreme political superstitions invest them, that<lb/>
in some royal instances, even to idiot imbecility<lb/>
they have imparted potency. But when, as in the<lb/>
case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of<lb/>
geographical empire encircles an imperial brain;<lb/>
then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the<lb/>
tremendous centralization. Nor will the tragic<lb/>
dramatist, who would depict mortal indomitable-<lb/>
ness in its fullest sweep and direst swing, ever<lb/>
forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art,<lb/>
as the one now alluded to.</p>
<p>But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me<lb/>
in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess,<lb/>
and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings,<lb/>
I must not conceal that I have only to do with<lb/>
a poor old whale-hunter like him; and, therefore,<lb/>
all outward majestical trappings and housings are<lb/>
denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in<lb/>
thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies,<lb/>
and dived for in the deeps, and featured in the<lb/>
unbodied air!</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXXIII.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the cabin-table</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward,<lb/>
thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face from the<lb/>
cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and<lb/>
master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has<lb/>
just been taking an observation of the sun, and is<lb/>
now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth,<lb/>
medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily<lb/>
purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From<lb/>
his complete inattention to the tidings, you would<lb/>
think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial.<lb/>
But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds,<lb/>
he swings himself to the deck, and in an even,<lb/>
unexhilarated voice, saying, &#x201C;Dinner, Mr. Star-<lb/>
buck,&#x201D; disappears into the cabin.</p>
<p>When the last echo of his sultan&#x0027;s step has died<lb/>
away, and Starbuck, the first Emir, has every<lb/>
reason to suppose that he is seated; then Star-<lb/>
buck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns<lb/>
along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the<lb/>
binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness,<lb/>
&#x201C;Dinner, Mr. Stubb,&#x201D; and descends the scuttle.<lb/>
The second Emir lounges about the rigging<lb/>
awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n253" n="236"/>
to see whether it be all right with that important<lb/>
rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and<lb/>
with a rapid &#x201C;Dinner, Mr. Flask,&#x201D; follows after<lb/>
his predecessors.</p>
<p>But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone<lb/>
on the quarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from<lb/>
some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of<lb/>
knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kick-<lb/>
ing off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noise-<lb/>
less squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand<lb/>
Turk&#x0027;s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight,<lb/>
pitching his cap up into the mizen-top for a shelf,<lb/>
he goes down rollicking, so far at least as he<lb/>
remains visible from the deck, reversing all other<lb/>
processions, by bringing up the rear with music.<lb/>
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below,<lb/>
he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and, then,<lb/>
independent, hilarious little Flask enters King<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s presence, in the character of Abjectus, or<lb/>
the Slave.</p>
<p>It is not the least among the strange things<lb/>
bred by the intense artificialness of sea-usages,<lb/>
that while in the open air of the deck some officers<lb/>
will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and<lb/>
defyingly enough towards their commander; yet,<lb/>
ten to one, let those very officers the next moment<lb/>
go down to their customary dinner in that same<lb/>
commander&#x0027;s cabin, and straightway their inoffen-<lb/>
sive, not to say deprecatory and humble air<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n254" n="237"/>
towards him, as he sits at the head of the table<lb/>
&#x2014;this is marvellous, sometimes most comical.<lb/>
Wherefore this difference? A problem? Perhaps<lb/>
not. To have been Belshazzar, King of Babylon,<lb/>
and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but<lb/>
courteously, therein certainly must have been<lb/>
some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who<lb/>
in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides<lb/>
over his own private dinner-table of invited guests<lb/>
&#x2014;that man&#x0027;s unchallenged power and dominion<lb/>
of individual influence for the time, that man&#x0027;s<lb/>
royalty of state transcends Belshazzar&#x0027;s, for Bel-<lb/>
shazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once<lb/>
dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be<lb/>
C&#x00E6;sar. It is a witchery of social czarship which<lb/>
there is no withstanding. Now, if to this con-<lb/>
sideration you superadd the official supremacy of<lb/>
a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive<lb/>
the cause of that peculiarity of sea-life just men-<lb/>
tioned.</p>
<p>Over this ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like<lb/>
a mute, maned sea-lion on the white coral beach,<lb/>
surrounded by his warlike but still deferential<lb/>
cubs. In his own proper tune, each officer waited<lb/>
to be served. They were as little children before<lb/>
Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to<lb/>
lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one<lb/>
mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old<lb/>
man&#x0027;s knife, as he carved the chief dish before<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n255" n="238"/>
him. I do not suppose that for the world they<lb/>
would have profaned that moment with the<lb/>
slightest observation, even upon so neutral a topic<lb/>
as the weather. No! And when reaching out<lb/>
his knife and fork, between which the slice of beef<lb/>
was locked, Ahab thereby motioned Starbuck&#x0027;s<lb/>
plate towards him, the mate received his meat as<lb/>
though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and<lb/>
a little started if, perchance, the knife grazed<lb/>
against the plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and<lb/>
swallowed it, not without circumspection. For,<lb/>
like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where<lb/>
the German Emperor profoundly dines with the<lb/>
seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were<lb/>
somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence;<lb/>
and yet at table old Ahab forbade not conversa-<lb/>
tion; only he himself was dumb. What a relief<lb/>
it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sud-<lb/>
den racket in the hold below. And poor little<lb/>
Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of<lb/>
this weary family party. His were the shin-bones<lb/>
of the saline beef; his would have been the drum-<lb/>
sticks. For Flask to have presumed to help him-<lb/>
self, this must have seemed to him tantamount<lb/>
to larceny in the first degree. Had he helped<lb/>
himself at that table, doubtless, never more would<lb/>
he have been able to hold his head up in this<lb/>
honest world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab<lb/>
never forbade him. And had Flask helped him-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n256" n="239"/>
self, the chances were Ahab had never so much as<lb/>
noticed it. Least of all, did Flask presume to<lb/>
help himself to butter. Whether he thought the<lb/>
owners of the ship denied it to him, on account<lb/>
of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or<lb/>
whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in<lb/>
such marketless waters, butter was at a premium,<lb/>
and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; how-<lb/>
ever it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!</p>
<p>Another thing. Flask was the last person down<lb/>
at the dinner, and Flask is the first man up.<lb/>
Consider! For hereby Flask&#x0027;s dinner was badly<lb/>
jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb<lb/>
both had the start of him: and yet they also<lb/>
have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If<lb/>
Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask,<lb/>
happens to have but a small appetite, and soon<lb/>
shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then<lb/>
Flask must bestir himself; he will not get more<lb/>
than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against<lb/>
holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.<lb/>
Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in<lb/>
private, that ever since he had arisen to the<lb/>
dignity of an officer&#x2014;from that moment he had<lb/>
never known what it was to be otherwise than<lb/>
hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so<lb/>
much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in<lb/>
him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have<lb/>
for ever departed from my stomach. I am an<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n257" n="240"/>
officer; but, how I wish I could fist a bit of old-<lb/>
fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when<lb/>
I was before the mast. There&#x0027;s the fruits of pro-<lb/>
motion now; there&#x0027;s the vanity of glory; there&#x0027;s<lb/>
the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that<lb/>
any mere sailor of the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> had a grudge<lb/>
against Flask in Flask&#x0027;s official capacity; all that<lb/>
sailor had to do, in order obtain ample vengeance,<lb/>
was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at<lb/>
Flask through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly<lb/>
and dumbfoundered before awful Ahab.</p>
<p>Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what<lb/>
may be called the first table in the <hi rend="i">Pequod&#x0027;s</hi><lb/>
cabin. After their departure, taking place in<lb/>
inverted order to their arrival, the canvas cloth<lb/>
was cleared, or rather was restored to some hur-<lb/>
ried method by the pallid steward. And then the<lb/>
three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they<lb/>
being its residuary legatees. They made a sort<lb/>
of temporary servants&#x0027; hall of the high and mighty<lb/>
cabin.</p>
<p>In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable con-<lb/>
straint and nameless invisible domineerings of the<lb/>
captain&#x0027;s table, was the entire care-free licence<lb/>
and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those<lb/>
inferior fellows, the harpooneers. While their<lb/>
masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of<lb/>
the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers<lb/>
chewed their food with such a relish that there<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n258" n="241"/>
was a report to it. They dined like lords; they<lb/>
filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading<lb/>
with spices. Such portentous appetites had Quee-<lb/>
queg and Tashtego, that to fill out the vacancies<lb/>
made by the previous repast, often the pale<lb/>
Dough-boy was fain to bring on a great baron of<lb/>
salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox.<lb/>
And if he were not lively about it, if he did not<lb/>
go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tash-<lb/>
tego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating<lb/>
him by darting a fork at his back, harpoonwise.<lb/>
And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humour,<lb/>
assisted Dough-boy&#x0027;s memory by snatching him<lb/>
up bodily and thrusting his head into a great<lb/>
empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in<lb/>
hand, began laying out the circle preliminary to<lb/>
scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,<lb/>
shuddering sort of little fellow&#x2014;this bread-faced<lb/>
steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and<lb/>
a hospital nurse. And what with the standing<lb/>
spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the perio-<lb/>
dical tumultous visitations of these three savages,<lb/>
Dough-Boy&#x0027;s whole life was one continual lip-<lb/>
quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers<lb/>
furnished with all things they demanded, he would<lb/>
escape from their clutches into his little pantry<lb/>
adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through<lb/>
the blinds of his door, till all was over.</p>
<p>It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n259" n="242"/>
against Tashtego, opposing his filed teeth to the<lb/>
Indian&#x0027;s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on<lb/>
the floor&#x2014;for a bench would have brought his<lb/>
hearse-plumed head to the low carlines&#x2014;at every<lb/>
motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin<lb/>
framework to shake, as when an African elephant<lb/>
goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the<lb/>
great negro was wonderfully abstemious, not to<lb/>
say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by<lb/>
such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep<lb/>
up the vitality diffused through so broad, baro-<lb/>
nial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this<lb/>
noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the<lb/>
abounding element of air, and through his dilated<lb/>
nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds.<lb/>
Not by beef or by bread, are giants made or nou-<lb/>
rished. But Queequeg&#x2014;he had a mortal, bar-<lb/>
baric smack of the lip in eating&#x2014;an ugly sound<lb/>
enough&#x2014;so much so, that the trembling Dough-<lb/>
Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of<lb/>
teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when<lb/>
he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to<lb/>
produce himself, that his bones might be picked,<lb/>
the simple-witted steward all but shattered the<lb/>
crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his<lb/>
sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the whetstones<lb/>
which the harpooneers carried in their pockets,<lb/>
for their lances and other weapons; and with<lb/>
which whetstones, at dinner, they would osten-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n260" n="243"/>
tatiously sharpen their knives&#x2014;that grating sound<lb/>
did not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-<lb/>
Boy. How could he forget that in his island<lb/>
days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been<lb/>
guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions.<lb/>
Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white waiter<lb/>
who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should<lb/>
he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good<lb/>
time, though, to his great delight, the three salt-<lb/>
sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credu-<lb/>
lous fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones<lb/>
jingling in them at every step, like Moorish sci-<lb/>
mitars in scabbards.</p>
<p>But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin,<lb/>
and nominally lived there; still, being anything<lb/>
but sedentary in their habits, they were scarcely<lb/>
ever in it except at meal-times, and just before<lb/>
sleeping-time, when they passed through it to<lb/>
their own peculiar quarters.</p>
<p>In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to<lb/>
most American whale captains, who, as a set, rather<lb/>
incline to the opinion that by rights the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
cabin belongs to them, and that it is by courtesy<lb/>
alone that anybody is, at any time, permitted<lb/>
there. So that, in real truth, the mates and har-<lb/>
pooneers of the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi> might more properly be<lb/>
said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.<lb/>
For when they did enter it, it was something as<lb/>
a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n261" n="244"/>
a moment, only to be turned out the next; ant,<lb/>
as a permanent thing, residing in the open air.<lb/>
Nor did they lose much thereby; in the cabin was<lb/>
no companionship; socially, Ahab was inacces-<lb/>
sible. Though nominally included in the census<lb/>
of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He<lb/>
lived in the worlds, as the last of the Grisly Bears<lb/>
lived in settled Missouri. And as when Spring<lb/>
and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of<lb/>
the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a<lb/>
tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own<lb/>
paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there<lb/>
fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!</p>

<div1 xml:id="t1-body-d34" type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XXXIV.<lb/>
<hi rend="sc">the mast-head</hi>.</head>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was during the more pleasant weather, that<lb/>
in due rotation with the other seamen my first<lb/>
mast-head came round.</p>
<p>In most American whalemen the mast-heads<lb/>
are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel&#x0027;s<lb/>
leaving her port; even though she may have<lb/>
fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reach-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n262" n="245"/>
ing her proper cruising ground. And if, after a<lb/>
three, four, or five years&#x0027; voyage, she is drawing<lb/>
nigh home with anything empty in her&#x2014;say an<lb/>
empty vial even&#x2014;then her mast-heads are kept<lb/>
manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles<lb/>
sail in among the spires of the port, does she<lb/>
altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one<lb/>
whale more.</p>
<p>Now, as the business of standing mast-heads,<lb/>
ashore or afloat, is a very ancient and interesting<lb/>
one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I<lb/>
take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads<lb/>
were the old Egyptians; because, in all my re-<lb/>
searches, I find none prior to them. For though<lb/>
their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must<lb/>
doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear<lb/>
the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either;<lb/>
yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that<lb/>
great stone mast of theirs may be said to have<lb/>
gone by the board, in the dread gale of God&#x0027;s<lb/>
wrath, therefore, we cannot give these Babel<lb/>
builders priority over the Egyptians. And that<lb/>
the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers,<lb/>
is an assertion based upon the general belief<lb/>
among arch&#x00E6;ologists, that the first pyramids were<lb/>
founded for astronomical purposes, a theory sin-<lb/>
gularly supported by the peculiar stair-like forma-<lb/>
tion of all four sides of those edifices: whereby,<lb/>
with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n263" n="246"/>
old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex,<lb/>
and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs<lb/>
of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale<lb/>
just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the<lb/>
famous Christian hermit of old times, who built<lb/>
him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent<lb/>
the whole latter portion of his life on its summit,<lb/>
hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle;<lb/>
in him we have a remarkable instance of a daunt-<lb/>
less stander of mast-heads, who was not to be<lb/>
driven from his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail,<lb/>
or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to<lb/>
the last, literally died at his post. Of modern<lb/>
standers of mast-heads to have but a lifeless set;<lb/>
mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though<lb/>
well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still<lb/>
entirely incompetent to the business of singing<lb/>
out upon discovering any strange sight. There<lb/>
is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column<lb/>
of Vend&#x00F4;me, stands with arms folded, some one<lb/>
hundred and fifty feet in the air; careless, now,<lb/>
who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,<lb/>
Louis Blanc, or Louis Napoleon. Great Wash-<lb/>
ington, too, stands high aloft on his towering<lb/>
main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules&#x0027;<lb/>
pillars, his column marks that point of human<lb/>
grandeur beyond which few mortals will go.<lb/>
Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal,<lb/>
stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n264" n="247"/>
even when most obscured by that London smoke,<lb/>
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there;<lb/>
for where there is smoke, must be fire. But<lb/>
neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor<lb/>
Nelson, will answer a single hail from below,<lb/>
however madly invoked to befriend by their<lb/>
counsels the distracted decks upon which they<lb/>
gaze; however it may be surmised, that their<lb/>
spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the<lb/>
future, and desery what shoals and what rocks<lb/>
must be shunned.</p>
<p>It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any<lb/>
respect the mast-head standers of the land with<lb/>
those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so,<lb/>
is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed<lb/>
Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket, stands<lb/>
accountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in<lb/>
the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships<lb/>
were regularly launched in pursuit of the game,<lb/>
the people of that island erected lofty spars along<lb/>
the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by<lb/>
means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go up<lb/>
stairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same<lb/>
plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New<lb/>
Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave<lb/>
notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.<lb/>
But this custom has now become obsolete; turn<lb/>
we then to the one proper mast-head, that of a<lb/>
whale-ship at sea.</p>
<pb xml:id="n265" n="248"/>
<p>The three masts are kept manned from sun-rise<lb/>
to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns,<lb/>
as at the helm, and relieving each other every<lb/>
two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics<lb/>
it is exceedingly pleasant&#x2014;the mast-head; nay,<lb/>
to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful.<lb/>
There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent<lb/>
decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts<lb/>
were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and between<lb/>
your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of<lb/>
the sea, even as ships once sailed between the<lb/>
boots of the famous Colossus at old Rhodes.<lb/>
There you stand, lost in the Infinite Series of<lb/>
the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves.<lb/>
The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy<lb/>
trade-winds blow; everything resolves you into<lb/>
languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling<lb/>
life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you: you<lb/>
hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with<lb/>
startling accounts of commonplaces never delude<lb/>
you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of<lb/>
no domestic afflictions, bankrupt securities, fall<lb/>
of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of<lb/>
what you shall have for dinner&#x2014;for all your<lb/>
meals for three years and more are snugly stowed<lb/>
in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.</p>
<p>In one of those southern whalemen, on a long<lb/>
three or four years&#x0027; voyage, as often happens, the<lb/>
sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n266" n="249"/>
head would amount to several entire months.<lb/>
And it is much to be deplored that the place to<lb/>
which you devote so considerable a portion of the<lb/>
whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly<lb/>
destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inha-<lb/>
bitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable local-<lb/>
ness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a ham-<lb/>
mock, a hearse, a sentry-box, a pulpit, a coach,<lb/>
or any other of those small and snug contrivances<lb/>
in which men temporarily isolate themselves.<lb/>
Your most usual point of perch is the head of the<lb/>
t&#x0027; gallant-mast, where you stand upon two thin<lb/>
parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called<lb/>
the t&#x0027; gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by<lb/>
the sea, the beginner feels about as cosy as he<lb/>
would standing on a bull&#x0027;s horns. To be sure,<lb/>
in coolish weather you may carry your house aloft<lb/>
with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but, pro-<lb/>
perly speaking, the thickest watch-coat is no more<lb/>
of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul<lb/>
is glued inside of its fleshly tabernacle, and can-<lb/>
not freely move about in it, nor even move out of<lb/>
it, without running great risk of perishing (like<lb/>
an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in<lb/>
winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house<lb/>
as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encas-<lb/>
ing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of<lb/>
drawers in your body, and no more can you make<lb/>
a convenient closet of your watch-coat.</p>
<pb xml:id="n267" n="250"/>
<p>Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored<lb/>
that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are<lb/>
unprovided with those enviable little tents or<lb/>
pulpits, called <hi rend="i">crows&#x0027;-nests</hi>, in which the look-outs<lb/>
of a Greenland whaler are protected from the<lb/>
inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the<lb/>
fire-side narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled &#x201C;A<lb/>
Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the<lb/>
Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-<lb/>
discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of<lb/>
Old Greenland;&#x201D; in this admirable volume, all<lb/>
standers of mast-heads are furnished with a<lb/>
charmingly circumstantial account of the then<lb/>
recently invented <hi rend="i">crow&#x0027;s-nest</hi> of the <hi rend="i">Glacier</hi>, which<lb/>
was the name of Captain Sleet&#x0027;s good craft. He<lb/>
called it the <hi rend="i">Sleet&#x0027;s crow&#x0027;s-nest</hi>, in honour of him-<lb/>
self, he being the original inventor and patentee, and<lb/>
free from all ridiculously false delicacy, and hold-<lb/>
ing that if we call our own children after our own<lb/>
names (we fathers being the original inventors and<lb/>
patentees), so likewise should we denominate after<lb/>
ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In<lb/>
shape, the Sleet&#x0027;s crow&#x0027;s-nest is something like<lb/>
a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however,<lb/>
where it is furnished with a movable side-screen<lb/>
to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.<lb/>
Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you<lb/>
ascend into it through a little trap-hatch in the<lb/>
bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n268" n="251"/>
of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker<lb/>
underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats.<lb/>
In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your<lb/>
speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nau-<lb/>
tical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in per-<lb/>
son stood his mast-head in this crow&#x0027;s nest of his,<lb/>
he tells us that he always had a rifle with him<lb/>
(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder<lb/>
flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the<lb/>
stray narwhals, or vagrant sea unicorns infesting<lb/>
those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot<lb/>
at them from the deck, owing to the resistance of<lb/>
the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very<lb/>
different thing. Now, it was plainly a labour of<lb/>
love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all<lb/>
the little detailed conveniences of his crow&#x0027;s-nest;<lb/>
but though he so enlarges upon many of these,<lb/>
and though he treats us to a very scientific account<lb/>
of his experiments in this crow&#x0027;s-nest, with a<lb/>
small compass he kept there for the purpose of<lb/>
counteracting the errors resulting from what is<lb/>
called the &#x201C;local attraction&#x201D; of all binnacle mag-<lb/>
nets: an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity<lb/>
of the iron in the ship&#x0027;s planks, (and in the Gla-<lb/>
cier&#x0027;s case, perhaps, to there having been so many<lb/>
broken-down blacksmiths among her crew;) I say,<lb/>
that though the Captain is very discreet and scien-<lb/>
tific here, yet, for all his learned &#x201C;binnacle devia-<lb/>
tions,&#x201D; &#x201C;azimuth compass observations,&#x201D; and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n269" n="252"/>
&#x201C;approximate errors,&#x201D; he knows very well&#x2014;Cap-<lb/>
tain Sleet&#x2014;that he was not so much immersed<lb/>
in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail<lb/>
being attracted occasionally towards that well<lb/>
replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in<lb/>
on one side of his crow&#x0027;s nest, within easy reach<lb/>
of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly<lb/>
admire and even love the brave, the honest, and<lb/>
learned Captain, yet I take it very ill of him that<lb/>
he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, see-<lb/>
ing what a faithful friend and comforter it must<lb/>
have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded<lb/>
head he was studying the mathematics aloft there<lb/>
in that bird&#x0027;s-nest within three or four perches of<lb/>
the pole.</p>
<p>But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so<lb/>
snugly housed aloft as Captain Sleet and his<lb/>
Greenland-men were, yet that disadvantage is<lb/>
greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrast-<lb/>
ing serenity of those seductive seas in which we<lb/>
Southern fishers mostly float. For one, I used<lb/>
to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in<lb/>
the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one<lb/>
else off duty whom I might find there; then<lb/>
ascending a little way further, and throwing a<lb/>
lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary<lb/>
view of the watery pastures, and so at last mount<lb/>
to my ultimate destination.</p>
<p>Let me make a clean breast of it here, and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n270" n="253"/>
frankly admit that I kept but sorry guard. With<lb/>
the problem of the universe revolving in me, how<lb/>
could I&#x2014;being left completely to myself at such<lb/>
a thought-engendering altitude,&#x2014;how could I but<lb/>
lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-<lb/>
ships&#x0027; standing orders, &#x201C;Keep your weather eye<lb/>
open, and sing out every time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And let me in this place movingly admonish<lb/>
you, ye ship-owners of Nantucket! Beware of<lb/>
enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with<lb/>
lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable<lb/>
meditativeness; and who offers to ship with the<lb/>
Ph&#x00E6;don instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware<lb/>
of such an one, I say: your whales must be seen<lb/>
before they are killed; and this sunken-eyed<lb/>
Platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world,<lb/>
and never make you one pint of sperm the richer.<lb/>
Nor are these monitions at all unneeded. For<lb/>
now-a-days, the whale-fishery furnishes an asylum<lb/>
for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-<lb/>
minded young men, disgusted with the carking<lb/>
cares of earth, and seeking sentiment in tar and<lb/>
blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches<lb/>
himself upon the mast head of some luckless<lb/>
disappointed whale-ship, and in moody phrase<lb/>
ejaculates:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!</p>
<p>Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Very often do the captains of such ships take<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n271" n="254"/>
those absent-minded young philosophers to task,<lb/>
upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient &#x201C;inte-<lb/>
rest&#x201D; in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so<lb/>
hopelessly lost to all honourable ambition, as that<lb/>
in their secret souls they would rather not see<lb/>
whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those<lb/>
young Platonists have a notion that their vision is<lb/>
imperfect; they are short-sighted&#x2014;what use, then,<lb/>
to strain the visual nerve? They have left their<lb/>
opera-glasses at home.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why, thou monkey,&#x201D; said an harpooneer to<lb/>
one of these lads, &#x201C;we&#x0027;ve been cruising now hard<lb/>
upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale<lb/>
yet. Whales are scarce as hen&#x0027;s teeth whenever<lb/>
thou art up here.&#x201D; Perhaps they were; or per-<lb/>
haps there might have been shoals of them in the<lb/>
far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like<lb/>
listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this<lb/>
absent-minded youth by the blending cadence of<lb/>
waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his<lb/>
identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for<lb/>
the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless<lb/>
soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every<lb/>
strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that<lb/>
eludes him&#x2014;every dimly-discovered, uprising fin<lb/>
of some undiscernible form&#x2014;seems to him the<lb/>
embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only<lb/>
people the soul by continually flitting through it.<lb/>
In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n272" n="255"/>
whence it came; becomes diffused through time<lb/>
and space; like Wickliff&#x0027;s sprinkled ashes, forming<lb/>
at last a part of every shore the round globe<lb/>
over.</p>
<p>There is no life in thee, now, except that rock-<lb/>
ing life imparted by a gently rolling ship; by her,<lb/>
borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the<lb/>
inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep,<lb/>
this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand an<lb/>
inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity<lb/>
comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices<lb/>
you hover. And perhaps, at mid-day, in the<lb/>
fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek, you<lb/>
drop through that transparent air into the sum-<lb/>
mer sea, no more to rise for ever. Heed it well,<lb/>
ye Pantheists!</p>

<quote>
<p><hi rend="i">(Enter Ahab: then, all.)</hi></p>
</quote>
<p><hi rend="sc">It</hi> was not a great while after the affair of the<lb/>
pipe, that one morning shortly after breakfast,<lb/>
Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gang-<lb/>
way to the deck. There most sea-captains usually<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n273" n="256"/>
walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after the<lb/>
same meal, take a few turns in the garden.</p>
<p>Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to<lb/>
and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so<lb/>
familiar to his tread, that they were all over<lb/>
dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar<lb/>
mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze, too, upon<lb/>
that ribbed and dented brow; there also you<lb/>
would see still stranger footprints&#x2014;the footprints<lb/>
of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.</p>
<p>But on the occasion in question, those dents<lb/>
looked deeper, even as his nervous step that<lb/>
morning left a deeper mark. And so full of his<lb/>
thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn<lb/>
that he made, now at the main-mast and now at<lb/>
the binnacle, you could almost see that thought<lb/>
turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he<lb/>
paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that<lb/>
it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer<lb/>
movement.</p>
<p>&#x201C;D&#x0027;ye mark him, Flask?&#x201D; whispered Stubb;<lb/>
&#x201C;the chick that&#x0027;s in him pecks the shell. T&#x0027;will<lb/>
soon be out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The hours wore on;&#x2014;Ahab now shut up within<lb/>
his cabin, anon, pacing the deck, with the same<lb/>
intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.</p>
<p>It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he<lb/>
came to a halt by the bulwarks, and inserting his<lb/>
bone leg into the augur-hole there, and with one<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n274" n="257"/>
hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to<lb/>
send everybody aft.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sir!&#x201D; said the mate, astonished at an order<lb/>
seldom or never given on ship-board, except in<lb/>
some extraordinary case.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Send everybody aft,&#x201D; repeated Ahab. &#x201C;Mast-<lb/>
heads, there! come down!&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the entire ship&#x0027;s company were assembled,<lb/>
and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive<lb/>
faces, were eyeing him&#x2014;for he looked not unlike<lb/>
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up&#x2014;-<lb/>
Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks,<lb/>
and then darting his eyes among the crew, started<lb/>
from his stand-point; and as though not a soul<lb/>
were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the<lb/>
deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he<lb/>
continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering<lb/>
whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously<lb/>
whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have sum-<lb/>
moned them there for the purpose of witnessing<lb/>
a pedestrian feat. But this did not last long.<lb/>
Vehemently pausing, he cried:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sing out for him!&#x201D; was the impulsive rejoin-<lb/>
der from a score of clubbed voices.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Good!&#x201D; cried Ahab, with a wild approval in<lb/>
his tones; observing the hearty animation into<lb/>
which his unexpected question had so magneti-<lb/>
cally thrown them.</p>
<pb xml:id="n275" n="258"/>
<p>&#x201C;And what do ye next, men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Lover away, and after him!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And what tune is it ye pull to, men?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;A dead whale or a stove boat!&#x201D;</p>
<p>More and more strangely and fiercely glad and<lb/>
approving grew the countenance of the old man<lb/>
at every shout; when the mariners began to gaze<lb/>
curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was<lb/>
that they themselves became so excited at such<lb/>
seemingly purposeless questions.</p>
<p>But they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now<lb/>
half-revolving in his pivot-hole, with one hand<lb/>
reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost<lb/>
convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;All ye mast-headers have before now heard<lb/>
me give orders about a white whale. Look ye!<lb/>
d&#x0027;ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?&#x201D;&#x2014;holding up<lb/>
a broad, bright coin to the sun&#x2014;&#x201D; it is a sixteen-<lb/>
dollar piece, men,&#x2014;a doubloon. D&#x0027;ye see it?.<lb/>
Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab,<lb/>
without speaking, was slowly rubbing the gold<lb/>
piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to<lb/>
heighten its lustre, and without using any words<lb/>
was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, pro-<lb/>
ducing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticu-<lb/>
late, that it seemed the mechanical humming of<lb/>
the wheels of his vitality in him.</p>
<p>Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he ad-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n276" n="259"/>
vanced towards the main-mast, with the hammer<lb/>
uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the<lb/>
other, and with a high-raised voice exclaiming:<lb/>
&#x201C;Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale<lb/>
with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whoso-<lb/>
ever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with<lb/>
three holes punctured in his starboard fluke&#x2014;look<lb/>
ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white<lb/>
whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Huzza! huzza!&#x201D; cried the seamen, as with<lb/>
swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing<lb/>
the gold to the mast.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It&#x0027;s a white whale, I say,&#x201D; resumed Ahab, as<lb/>
he threw down the top-maul; &#x201C;a white whale.<lb/>
Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white<lb/>
water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg<lb/>
had looked on with even more intense interest<lb/>
and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of<lb/>
the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had<lb/>
started as if each was separately touched by some<lb/>
specific recollection.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab,&#x201D; said Tashtego, &#x201C;that white<lb/>
whale must be the same that some call Moby<lb/>
Dick.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Moby Dick?&#x201D; shouted Ahab. &#x201C;Do you know<lb/>
the white whale then, Tash?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he<lb/>
goes down?&#x201D; said the Gay-Header, deliberately.</p>
<pb xml:id="n277" n="260"/>
<p>&#x201C;And has he a curious spout, too,&#x201D; said Daggoo,<lb/>
&#x201C;very bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty<lb/>
quick, Captain Ahab?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And he have one, two, tree&#x2014;oh! good many<lb/>
iron in him hide, too, Captain,&#x201D; cried Queequeg,<lb/>
disjointedly, &#x201C;all twisketee be-twisk, like him&#x2014;-<lb/>
him&#x2014;&#x201D; faltering hard for a word, and screwing<lb/>
his hand round and round as though uncorking a<lb/>
bottle&#x2014;&#x201D; like him&#x2014;him&#x2014;&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Corkscrew!&#x201D; cried Ahab; &#x201C;aye, Queequeg,<lb/>
the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him:<lb/>
aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole<lb/>
shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nan-<lb/>
tucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing:<lb/>
aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a<lb/>
squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick<lb/>
ye have seen&#x2014;Moby Dick&#x2014;Moby Dick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Captain Ahab,&#x201D; said Starbuck, who, with<lb/>
Stubbs and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his<lb/>
superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed<lb/>
struck with a thought which somewhat explained<lb/>
all the wonder: &#x201C;Captain Ahab, I have heard of<lb/>
Moby Dick; but it was not Moby Dick that took<lb/>
off thy leg?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who told thee that?&#x201D; cried Ahab; then,<lb/>
pausing, &#x201C;Aye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all<lb/>
round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby<lb/>
Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand<lb/>
on now. Aye, aye,&#x201D; he shouted with a terrific, loud,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n278" n="261"/>
animal shout, like that of a heart-stricken moose;<lb/>
&#x201C;Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that<lb/>
razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for<lb/>
ever and a day!&#x201D; Then tossing both arms, with<lb/>
measureless imprecations he shouted out: &#x201C;Aye,<lb/>
aye! and I&#x0027;ll chase him round Good Hope, and<lb/>
round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,<lb/>
and round perdition&#x0027;s flames, before I give him up.<lb/>
And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to<lb/>
chase that white whale on both sides of land, and<lb/>
over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood<lb/>
and rolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye splice<lb/>
hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aye, aye!&#x201D; shouted the harpooneers and sea-<lb/>
men, running closer to the excited old man: &#x201C;A<lb/>
sharp eye for the White Whale; a sharp lance for<lb/>
Moby Dick!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;God bless ye,&#x201D; he seemed to half sob and half<lb/>
shout. God bless ye, men. Steward! go draw<lb/>
the great measure of grog. But what&#x0027;s this long<lb/>
face about, Mr. Starbuck: wilt thou not chase the<lb/>
white whale? art not game for Moby Dick?&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the<lb/>
jaws of Death too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes<lb/>
in the way of the business we follow; but I came<lb/>
here to hunt whales, not my commander&#x0027;s ven-<lb/>
geance. How many barrels will thy vengeance yield<lb/>
thee, even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab? it will<lb/>
not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.&#x201D;</p>
<pb xml:id="n279" n="262"/>
<p>&#x201C;Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer,<lb/>
Starbuck; thou requirest a little lower layer. If<lb/>
money&#x0027;s to be the measurer, man, and the account-<lb/>
ants have computed their great counting-house<lb/>
the globe, by girdling it with guineas, one to every<lb/>
three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee, that<lb/>
my vengeance will fetch a great premium <hi rend="i">here!</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>&#x201C;He smites his chest,&#x201D; whispered Stubb,<lb/>
&#x201C;what&#x0027;s that for, methinks it rings most vast,<lb/>
but hollow.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Vengeance on a dumb brute!&#x201D; cried Star-<lb/>
buck, &#x201C;that simply smote thee from blindest<lb/>
instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb<lb/>
thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hark ye yet again,&#x2014;the little lower layer.<lb/>
All visible objects, man, are but as pasteboard<lb/>
masks. But in each event&#x2014;in the living act, the<lb/>
undoubted deed&#x2014;there, some unknown but still<lb/>
reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its<lb/>
features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man<lb/>
will strike, strike through the mask! How can<lb/>
the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting<lb/>
through the wall? To me, the white whale is that<lb/>
wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there&#x0027;s<lb/>
nought beyond. But &#x0027;tis enough. He tasks me;<lb/>
he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength,<lb/>
with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That in-<lb/>
scrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the<lb/>
white whale agent, or be the white whale prin-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n280" n="263"/>
cipal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not<lb/>
to me of blasphemy, men; I&#x0027;d strike the sun if it<lb/>
insulted me. For could the sun do that, then<lb/>
could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of<lb/>
fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all crea-<lb/>
tions. But not my master, man, is even that fair<lb/>
play. Who&#x0027;s over me? Truth hath no confines.<lb/>
Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends&#x0027;<lb/>
glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou red-<lb/>
denest and palest; my heat has melted thee to<lb/>
anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said<lb/>
in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men<lb/>
from whom warm words are small indignity. I<lb/>
meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see<lb/>
yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn&#x2014;living,<lb/>
breathing pictures painted by the sun. The<lb/>
pagan leopards&#x2014;the unreeking and unworship-<lb/>
ping things that live, and seek, and give no<lb/>
reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew,<lb/>
man, the crew! Are they not one and all with<lb/>
Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb!<lb/>
he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to<lb/>
think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane,<lb/>
thy one tost saplin cannot, Starbuck! And what<lb/>
is it? Reckon it. &#x0027;Tis but to help strike a fin; no<lb/>
wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more?<lb/>
From this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out<lb/>
of all Nantucket, surely he will not hang back,<lb/>
when every foremast-hand has clutched a whet-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n281" n="264"/>
stone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the<lb/>
billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak!&#x2014;Aye, aye!<lb/>
thy silence, that&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that</hi> voices thee. (<hi rend="i">Aside</hi>.) Some-<lb/>
thing shot from my dilated nostrils: he has in-<lb/>
haled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine;<lb/>
cannot oppose me, without rebellion.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;God keep me!&#x2014;keep us all!&#x201D; murmured<lb/>
Starbuck, lowly.</p>
<p>But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquies-<lb/>
cence of the mate, Ahab, did not hear his forbod-<lb/>
ing invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the<lb/>
hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the<lb/>
winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap of<lb/>
the sails against the masts, as for a moment their<lb/>
hearts sank in. For again Starbuck&#x0027;s downcast<lb/>
eyes lighted up with the stubborness of life; the<lb/>
subterranean laugh died away; the winds blew<lb/>
on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and<lb/>
rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warn-<lb/>
ings! why stay ye not when ye come? But rather<lb/>
are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows!<lb/>
Yet not so much predictions from without, as<lb/>
verifications of the foregoing things within. For<lb/>
with little external to constrain us, the innermost<lb/>
necessities in our being&#x2014;these still drive us on.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The measure! the measure!&#x201D; cried Ahab.</p>
<p>Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to<lb/>
the harpooneers, he ordered them to produce their<lb/>
weapons. Then ranging them before him near the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n282" n="265"/>
capstan, with, their harpoons in their hands, while<lb/>
his three mates stood at his side with their lances,<lb/>
and the rest of the ship&#x0027;s company formed a circle<lb/>
round the group? he stood for an instant search-<lb/>
ingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those<lb/>
wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the<lb/>
prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader, ere he<lb/>
rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison;<lb/>
but, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the<lb/>
Indian.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Drink and pass!&#x201D; he cried, handing the<lb/>
heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman.<lb/>
&#x201C;The crew alone now drink. Round with it,<lb/>
round! Short draughts&#x2014;long swallows, men;<lb/>
&#x0027;tis hot as Satan&#x0027;s hoof. So, so; it goes round<lb/>
excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the<lb/>
serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained.<lb/>
That way it went, this way it comes. Hand it<lb/>
me&#x2014;here&#x0027;s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years;<lb/>
so brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward,<lb/>
refill!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye<lb/>
all round this capstan; and ye mates flank me<lb/>
with your lances; and ye harpooneers stand there<lb/>
with your irons; and ye stout mariners ring me<lb/>
in, that I may in some sort revive an old custom<lb/>
of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you<lb/>
will yet see that&#x2014;Ha! boy, come back? bad<lb/>
pennies come not sooner. Hand it me. Why,<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n283" n="266"/>
now, this pewter had run brimming again, wert<lb/>
not thou St. Vitus&#x0027; imp&#x2014;away, thou ague!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full<lb/>
before me. Well done! Let me touch the axis.&#x201D;<lb/>
So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the<lb/>
three level, radiating lances at their crossed cen-<lb/>
tre; while so doing, suddenly and nervously<lb/>
twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently<lb/>
from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask.<lb/>
It seemed as though, by some nameless, interior<lb/>
volition, he would fain have shocked them into the<lb/>
same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden<lb/>
jar of his own magnetic life. The three mates<lb/>
quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic<lb/>
aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from<lb/>
him; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright.</p>
<p>&#x201C;In vain!&#x201D; cried Ahab; &#x201C;but, maybe, &#x0027;tis<lb/>
well. For did ye three but once take the full-<lb/>
forced shock, then mine own electric thing&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that</hi><lb/>
had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance,<lb/>
too, it would have dropped ye dead. Perchance<lb/>
ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye<lb/>
mates, I do appoint ye three cup-bearers to my<lb/>
three pagan kinsmen there &#x2014; you three most<lb/>
honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant<lb/>
harpooneers. Disdain the task? What, when<lb/>
the great pope washes the feet of beggars, using<lb/>
his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals!<lb/>
your own condescension&#x2014;<hi rend="i">that</hi> shall bend ye to it.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n284" n="267"/>
I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings<lb/>
and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Silently obeying the order, the three har-<lb/>
pooneers now stood with the detached iron part of<lb/>
their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs<lb/>
up, before him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant<lb/>
them; cant them over! know ye not the goblet<lb/>
end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-<lb/>
bearers, advance. The irons! take them; hold<lb/>
them while I fill!&#x201D; Forthwith, slowly going from<lb/>
one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon<lb/>
sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the<lb/>
murderous chalices! Bestow them, ye who are<lb/>
now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!<lb/>
Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying<lb/>
sun now waits to sit upon it. Drink, ye harpooneers!<lb/>
drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful<lb/>
whaleboat&#x0027;s bow&#x2014;Death to Moby Dick! God hunt<lb/>
us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death!&#x201D;</p>
<p>The long, barbed steel goblets were lifted; and<lb/>
to cries and maledictions against the white whale,<lb/>
the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with<lb/>
a hiss. Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered.<lb/>
Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter<lb/>
went the rounds among the frantic crew; when,<lb/>
waving his free hand to them, they all dispersed;<lb/>
and Ahab retired within his cabin.</p>

the number who as yet had actually and knowingly<lb/>
given battle to him, was small indeed. For,<lb/>
owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the<lb/>
disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire<lb/>
watery circumference&#x2014;many of them adventure-<lb/>
ously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes,<lb/>
so as seldom or never, for a whole twelvemonth or<lb/>
more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-<lb/>
telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of<lb/>
each separate voyage&#x2014;the irregularity of the<lb/>
times of sailing from home; all these, with other<lb/>
circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed<lb/>
the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-<lb/>
fleet of the special individualizing tidings concern-<lb/>
ing Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted,<lb/>
that several vessels reported to have encountered,<lb/>
at such or such a time, or on such or such a meri-<lb/>
dian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude<lb/>
and malignity, which whale, after doing great<lb/>
mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped<lb/>
them;&#x2014;to some minds it was not an unfair pre-<lb/>
sumption, I say, that the whale in question must<lb/>
have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet, as of<lb/>
late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by<lb/>
various and not unfrequent instances of great<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n301" n="284"/>
ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster<lb/>
attacked; therefore it was, that those who by<lb/>
accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick,<lb/>
such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were<lb/>
content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred<lb/>
more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale<lb/>
fishery at large, than to the individual cause. In<lb/>
that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between<lb/>
Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly<lb/>
regarded.</p>
<p>And as for those who, previously hearing of the<lb/>
White Whale, by chance caught sight of him; in<lb/>
the beginning of the thing they had every one of<lb/>
them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for<lb/>
him, as for any other whale of that species. But<lb/>
at length, such calamities did ensue in these<lb/>
assaults&#x2014;not restricted to sprained wrists and<lb/>
ancles, broken limbs, or devouring amputations&#x2014;-<lb/>
but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those re-<lb/>
peated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and<lb/>
piling their terrors upon Moby Dick&#x2014;those things<lb/>
had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave<lb/>
hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale<lb/>
had eventually come.</p>
<p>Nor did wild rumours of all sorts fail to ex-<lb/>
aggerate, and still the more horrify, the true<lb/>
histories of these deadly encounters. For not<lb/>
only do fabulous rumours naturally grow out of<lb/>
the very body of all surprising terrible events,&#x2014;-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n302" n="285"/>
as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but,<lb/>
in maritime life, far more than in that of terra<lb/>
firma, wild rumours abound, wherever there is any<lb/>
adequate reality for them to cling to. And as the<lb/>
sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale<lb/>
fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life,<lb/>
in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the ru-<lb/>
mours which sometimes circulate there. For not<lb/>
only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that<lb/>
ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all<lb/>
sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the<lb/>
most directly brought into contact with whatever<lb/>
is appallingly astonishing in the sea: face to face,<lb/>
they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand<lb/>
to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such, re-<lb/>
motest waters, that though you sailed a thousand<lb/>
miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would<lb/>
not come to any chiselled hearthstone, or aught<lb/>
hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such<lb/>
latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a call-<lb/>
ing as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by<lb/>
influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant<lb/>
with many a mighty birth.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that ever-gathering volume<lb/>
from the mere transit over the widest watery<lb/>
spaces, the outblown rumours ofthe White Whale<lb/>
did in the end incorporate with themselves all<lb/>
manner of morbid hints, and half-formed f&#x0153;tal<lb/>
suggestions of supernatural agencies, which even-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n303" n="286"/>
tually invested Moby Dick with new terrors un-<lb/>
borrowed from anything that visibly appears. So<lb/>
that in many cases such a panic did he finally<lb/>
strike, that few who by those rumours, at least,<lb/>
had heard of the White Whale, few of those<lb/>
hunters were willing to encounter the perils of<lb/>
his jaw.</p>
<p>But there were still other and more vital prac-<lb/>
tical influences at work. Not even at the present<lb/>
day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale,<lb/>
as fearfully distinguished from all other species<lb/>
of the leviathan, died out of the minds of the<lb/>
whalemen as a body. There are those this day<lb/>
among them, who, though intelligent and coura-<lb/>
geous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or<lb/>
Right Whale, would perhaps&#x2014;either from profess-<lb/>
sional inexperience, or incompetency, or timidity,<lb/>
decline a contest with the Sperm Whale. At any<lb/>
rate, there are plenty of whalemen, especially<lb/>
among those whaling nations not sailing under<lb/>
the American flag, who have never hostilely en-<lb/>
countered the Sperm Whale, but whose sole<lb/>
knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the<lb/>
ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North.<lb/>
Seated on their hatches, these men will hearken<lb/>
with a childish fire-side interest and awe, to the<lb/>
wild, strange tales of Southern whaling. Nor<lb/>
is the preeminent tremendousness of the great<lb/>
Sperm Whale anywhere more feelingly compre-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n304" n="287"/>
hended, than on board of those prows which stem<lb/>
him.</p>
<p>And as if the now tested reality of his might<lb/>
had in former legendary times thrown its shadow<lb/>
before it; we find some book naturalists&#x2014;Olassen<lb/>
and Povelson&#x2014;declaring the Sperm Whale not<lb/>
only to be a consternation to every other creature<lb/>
in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious<lb/>
as continually to be athirst for human blood.<lb/>
Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier&#x0027;s, were<lb/>
these or almost similar impressions effaced. For<lb/>
in his Natural History, the Baron himself affirms<lb/>
that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks<lb/>
included) are &#x201C;struck with the most lively<lb/>
terrors,&#x201D; and &#x201C;often in the precipitancy of their<lb/>
flight dash themselves against the rocks with such<lb/>
violence as to cause instantaneous death.&#x201D; And<lb/>
however the general experiences in the fishery<lb/>
may amend such reports as these; yet in their full<lb/>
terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of<lb/>
Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is, in<lb/>
some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the<lb/>
minds of the hunters.</p>
<p>So that overawed by the rumours and portents<lb/>
concerning him, not a few of the fishermen re-<lb/>
called, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier<lb/>
days of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was<lb/>
oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right<lb/>
whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n305" n="288"/>
daring warfare; such men protesting that, al-<lb/>
though other leviathans might be hopefully pur-<lb/>
sued, yet to chase and point lance at such an<lb/>
apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for<lb/>
mortal man&#x2014;that to attempt it, would be inevita-<lb/>
bly to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head,<lb/>
there are some remarkable documents that may<lb/>
be consulted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the<lb/>
face of these things were ready to give chase to<lb/>
Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,<lb/>
chancing only to hear of him distantly and<lb/>
vaguely, without the specific details of any certain<lb/>
calamity, and without superstitious accompany-<lb/>
ments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from<lb/>
the battle, if offered.</p>
<p>One of the wild suggestings referred to, as at<lb/>
last coming to be linked with the White Whale<lb/>
in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was<lb/>
the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was<lb/>
ubiquitous; that he had actually been encoun-<lb/>
tered in opposite latitudes at one and the same<lb/>
instant of time.</p>
<p>Nor, eredulous as such minds must have been,<lb/>
was this conceit altogether without some faint<lb/>
show of superstitious probability. For, as the<lb/>
secrets of the currents in the seas have never<lb/>
yet been divulged, even to the most erudite re-<lb/>
search; so the bidden ways of the Sperm Whale<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n306" n="289"/>
when beneath the surface remain, in great part,<lb/>
unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time<lb/>
to time have originated the most curious and<lb/>
contradictory speculations regarding them, espe-<lb/>
cially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after<lb/>
sounding to a great depth, he transports himself<lb/>
with such vast swiftness to the most widely dis-<lb/>
tant points.</p>
<p>It is a thing well known to both American and<lb/>
English whale ships, and also a thing placed upon<lb/>
authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that<lb/>
some whales have been captured far north in the<lb/>
Pacific, in whose bodies have been found the barbs<lb/>
of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it<lb/>
to be gainsayed, that in some of these instances it<lb/>
has been declared that the interval of time between<lb/>
the two assaults could not have exceeded very many<lb/>
days. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by<lb/>
some whalemen, that the Nor&#x0027; West Passage, so long<lb/>
a problem to man, was never a problem to the whale.<lb/>
So that here, in the real living experience of living<lb/>
men, the prodigies related in old times of the inland<lb/>
Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there<lb/>
was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships<lb/>
floated up to the surface); and that still more won-<lb/>
derful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse<lb/>
(whose waters were believed to have come from the<lb/>
Holy Land by an underground passage); these<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n307" n="290"/>
fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the<lb/>
realities of the whaleman.</p>
<p>Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies<lb/>
as these, and knowing that after repeated intrepid<lb/>
assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive; it<lb/>
cannot be much matter of surprise that some whale-<lb/>
men should go still further in their superstitions;<lb/>
declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but im-<lb/>
mortal (for mortality is but ubiquity in time); that<lb/>
though groves of spears should be planted in his<lb/>
flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if<lb/>
indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood,<lb/>
such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for<lb/>
again in unensanguined billows, hundreds of leagues<lb/>
away, his unsullied jet would once more be seen.</p>
<p>But even stripped of these supernatural sur-<lb/>
misings, there was enough in the earthly make and<lb/>
incontestible character of the monster to strike the<lb/>
imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not<lb/>
so much his uncommon bulk that so much distin-<lb/>
guished him from other Sperm whales, but&#x2014;as was<lb/>
elsewhere thrown out&#x2014;a peculiar snow-white<lb/>
wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical, white<lb/>
hump. These were his prominent features; the<lb/>
tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted<lb/>
seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance,<lb/>
to those who knew him.</p>
<p>The rest of his body was so streaked, and spot-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n308" n="291"/>
ted, and marbled with the same shrouded hue, that,<lb/>
in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation<lb/>
of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally<lb/>
justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at<lb/>
high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-<lb/>
way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden<lb/>
gleamings. Nor was it his unwonted magnitude,<lb/>
nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed lower<lb/>
jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural<lb/>
terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity<lb/>
which, according to specific accounts, he had over<lb/>
and over again evinced in his assaults. More than<lb/>
all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay<lb/>
than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming<lb/>
before his exulting pursuers, with every apparent<lb/>
symptom of alarm, he had several times been known<lb/>
to turn round suddenly, and bearing down upon<lb/>
them, either stave their boats to splinters, or drive<lb/>
them back in consternation to their ship.</p>
<p>Already several fatalities had attended his chase.<lb/>
But though similar disasters, however little bruited<lb/>
ashore, were by no means unusual in the fishery;<lb/>
yet, in most instances, such seemed the White<lb/>
Whale&#x0027;s infernal forethought of ferocity, that every<lb/>
dismembering or death that he caused, was not<lb/>
wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an<lb/>
unintelligent agent.</p>
<p>Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, dis-<lb/>
tracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n309" n="292"/>
were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed<lb/>
boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they<lb/>
swam out of the white curds of the whale&#x0027;s direful<lb/>
wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that<lb/>
smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.</p>
<p>His three boats stove around him, and oars and<lb/>
men both whirling in the eddies; one captain,<lb/>
seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had<lb/>
dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his<lb/>
foe, blindly seeking with a six-inch blade to reach<lb/>
the fathom-deep life of the whale. That captain<lb/>
was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweep-<lb/>
ing his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby<lb/>
Dick had reaped away Ahab&#x0027;s leg, as a mower a<lb/>
blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no<lb/>
hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him<lb/>
with more seeming malice. Small reason was<lb/>
there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost<lb/>
fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindic-<lb/>
tiveness against the whale, all the more fell, for<lb/>
that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to<lb/>
identify with him, not only all his bodily woes,<lb/>
but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations.<lb/>
The White Whale swam before him as the mono-<lb/>
maniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies<lb/>
which some deep men feel eating in them, till they<lb/>
are left living on with half a heart and half a<lb/>
lung. That intangible malignity which has been<lb/>
from the beginning; which the ancient Ophites<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n310" n="293"/>
of the east reverenced in their statue devil;&#x2014;-<lb/>
Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them;<lb/>
but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred<lb/>
white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated,<lb/>
against it. All that most maddens and torments;<lb/>
all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with<lb/>
malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes<lb/>
the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and<lb/>
thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly<lb/>
personified, and made practically assailable in<lb/>
Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale&#x0027;s white<lb/>
hump the sum of all the general rage and hate<lb/>
felt by his whole race from Adam down; and<lb/>
then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst<lb/>
his hot heart&#x0027;s shell upon it.</p>
<p>It is not probable that this monomania in him<lb/>
took its instant rise at the precise time of his<lb/>
bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the<lb/>
monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose<lb/>
to a sudden, passionate, corporal animosity; and<lb/>
when he received the stroke that tore him, he<lb/>
probably felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but<lb/>
nothing more. Yet, when by this collision forced<lb/>
to turn towards home, and for long months of<lb/>
days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched<lb/>
together in one hammock, rounding in mid-winter<lb/>
that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it<lb/>
was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into<lb/>
one another; and so interfusing made him mad.<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n311" n="294"/>
That it was only then, on the homeward voyage,<lb/>
after the encounter, that the final monomania<lb/>
seized him, seems all but certain from the fact<lb/>
that, at intervals during the passage, he was a<lb/>
raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg,<lb/>
yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian<lb/>
chest, and was moreover intensified by his deli-<lb/>
rium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast,<lb/>
even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock.<lb/>
In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings<lb/>
of the gales. And, when running into more suf-<lb/>
ferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun&#x0027;sails<lb/>
spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to<lb/>
all appearances, the old man&#x0027;s delirium seemed<lb/>
left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and<lb/>
he came forth from his dark den into the blessed<lb/>
light and air;&#x2014;even then, when he bore that<lb/>
firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his<lb/>
calm orders once again; and his mates thanked<lb/>
God the direful madness was now gone;&#x2014;even<lb/>
then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human<lb/>
madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline<lb/>
thing. When you think it fled, it may have but<lb/>
become transfigured into some still subtler form.<lb/>
Ahab&#x0027;s full lunacy subsided not, but deepningly<lb/>
contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that<lb/>
noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably,<lb/>
through the Highland gorge. But, as in his<lb/>
narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab&#x0027;s<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n312" n="295"/>
broad madness had been left behind; so in that<lb/>
broad madness, not one jot of his great natural<lb/>
intellect had perished. That before living agent,<lb/>
now became the living instrument. If such a<lb/>
furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed<lb/>
his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all<lb/>
its concentrated cannon upon its own mad mark;<lb/>
so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab,<lb/>
to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold<lb/>
more potency than ever he had sanely brought to<lb/>
bear upon any one reasonable object.</p>
<p>This is much; yet Ahab&#x0027;s larger, darker, deeper<lb/>
part remains unhinted. But vain to popularize<lb/>
profundities&#x2014;and all truth is profound. Winding<lb/>
far down from within the very heart of this spiked<lb/>
Hotel de Cluny where we here stand&#x2014;however<lb/>
grand and wonderful, now quit it; and take your<lb/>
way, ye nobler, and sadder souls, to those vast<lb/>
Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the<lb/>
fantastic towers of man&#x0027;s upper earth, his root of<lb/>
grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded<lb/>
state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and<lb/>
throned on torsos! So with a broken throne,<lb/>
the great gods mock that captive king; so like a<lb/>
Caryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen<lb/>
brow the piled entablatures of ages. Wind ye<lb/>
down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question<lb/>
that proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye,<lb/>
he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n313" n="296"/>
from your grim sire only will the old state-secret<lb/>
come.</p>
<p>Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of<lb/>
this, namely: all my means are sane, my motive<lb/>
and my object mad. Yet without power to kill,<lb/>
or change, or shum the fact; he likewise knew<lb/>
that to mankind he did long dissemble&#x2014;in some<lb/>
sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling<lb/>
was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his<lb/>
will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he<lb/>
succeed in that dissembling, that when with ivory<lb/>
leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer<lb/>
thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved,<lb/>
and that to the quick, with the terrible casualty<lb/>
which had overtaken him.</p>
<p>The report of his undeniable delirium at sea<lb/>
was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause.<lb/>
And so too, all the added moodiness which always<lb/>
afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the <hi rend="i">Pequod</hi><lb/>
on the present voyage, sat brooding on his brow.<lb/>
Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from&#x0027; distrusting<lb/>
his fitness for another whaling voyage, on account<lb/>
of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of<lb/>
that prudent isle were inclined to harbour the<lb/>
conceit, that for those very reasons he was all the<lb/>
better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so<lb/>
full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of<lb/>
whales. Gnawed within and sore without, with<lb/>
the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n314" n="297"/>
idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem<lb/>
the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance<lb/>
against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if<lb/>
for any reason thought to be corporeally incapa-<lb/>
citated for that, yet such an one would seem<lb/>
superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his<lb/>
underlings to the attack. But be all this as it<lb/>
may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his<lb/>
unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab<lb/>
had purposely sailed upon the present voyage<lb/>
with the only and all-engrossing object of hunting<lb/>
the White Whale. Had any of his old acquaint-<lb/>
ances on shore but half dreamed of what was<lb/>
lurking in him then, how soon would their aghast<lb/>
and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from<lb/>
such a fiendish man! They were bent on profit-<lb/>
able cruises, the profit to be counted down in<lb/>
dollars from the mint. He was intent on an<lb/>
audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.</p>
<p>Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old<lb/>
man, chasing with curses a Job&#x0027;s whale round the<lb/>
world; at the head of a crew, too, that chiefly<lb/>
made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways,<lb/>
and cannibals&#x2014;morally enfeebled also, by the<lb/>
incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-<lb/>
mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity<lb/>
of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the<lb/>
pervading mediocrity in Flask;&#x2014;such a crew, so<lb/>
officered, seemed specially picked and packed by<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n315" n="298"/>
some infernal fatality to help him to his mono-<lb/>
maniac revenge. How it was that they so abound-<lb/>
ingly responded to the old man&#x0027;s ire&#x2014;by what<lb/>
evil magic their souls were possessed, that at<lb/>
times his hate seemed almost theirs; the White<lb/>
Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how<lb/>
all this came to be&#x2014;what the White Whale was<lb/>
to them, or how to their unconscious understand-<lb/>
ings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he<lb/>
might have seemed the gliding great demon of<lb/>
the seas of life,&#x2014;all this to explain, would be to<lb/>
dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subter-<lb/>
ranean miner that works in us all, how can one<lb/>
tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting,<lb/>
muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel<lb/>
the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of<lb/>
a seventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave<lb/>
myself up to the abandonment of the time and<lb/>
the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter<lb/>
the whale, could see naught in that brute but the<lb/>
deadliest ill.</p>

<pb xml:id="n316" n="299"/>
<p>Aside from those more obvious considerations<lb/>
touching Moby Dick, which could not but occa-<lb/>
sionally awaken in any man&#x0027;s soul some alarm,<lb/>
there was another thought, or rather vague, name-<lb/>
less horror concerning him, which at times by its<lb/>
intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and<lb/>
yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that<lb/>
I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible<lb/>
form. It was the whiteness of the whale that<lb/>
above all things appalled me. But how can I<lb/>
hope to explain myself here? and yet, in some<lb/>
dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all<lb/>
these chapters might be nought.</p>
<p>Though in many natural objects, whiteness re-<lb/>
finingly enhances beauty, as if imparting some<lb/>
special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas,<lb/>
and pearls; and though various nations have in<lb/>
some way recognised a certain royal preeminence<lb/>
in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of<lb/>
Pegu placing the title &#x201C;Lord of the White Ele-<lb/>
phants&#x201D; above all their other magniloquent ascrip-<lb/>
tions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam<lb/>
unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the<lb/>
royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing<lb/>
the one figure of a snow-white charger: and the<lb/>
great Austrian Empire, C&#x00E6;sarian heir to over-<lb/>
lording Rome, having for the imperial colour the<lb/>
same imperial hue; and though this pre-eminence<lb/>
in it applies to the human race itself, giving the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n317" n="300"/>
white man ideal mastership over every dusky<lb/>
tribe; and though, besides all this, whiteness has<lb/>
been even made significant of gladness &#x2014; for<lb/>
among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful<lb/>
day&#x2014;and though in other mortal sympathies and<lb/>
symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem<lb/>
of many touching, noble things&#x2014;the innocence of<lb/>
brides, the benignity of age; though among the<lb/>
Red Men of America the giving of the white belt<lb/>
of wampum was the deepest pledge of honour;<lb/>
though in many climes, whiteness typifies the<lb/>
majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge,<lb/>
and contributes to the daily state of kings and<lb/>
queens drawn by milk-white steeds; though even<lb/>
in the higher mysteries of the most august reli-<lb/>
gions it has been made the symbol of the divine<lb/>
spotlessness and power; by the Persian fire-wor-<lb/>
shipper, the white forked flame being held the<lb/>
holiest on the altar, and in the Greek mythologies<lb/>
Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a<lb/>
snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iro-<lb/>
quois, the mid-winter sacrifice of the sacred White<lb/>
Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theo-<lb/>
logy, that spotless, faithful creature being held<lb/>
the purest envoy they could send to the Great<lb/>
Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fide-<lb/>
lity; and though directly from the Latin word for<lb/>
white, all Christian priests derive the name of one<lb/>
part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n318" n="301"/>
beneath the cassock; and though among the holy<lb/>
pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially em-<lb/>
ployed in the celebration of the Passion of our<lb/>
Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white<lb/>
robes are given to the redeemed, and the four-<lb/>
and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before<lb/>
the great white throne, and the Holy One that<lb/>
sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these<lb/>
accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet,<lb/>
and honourable, and sublime, there yet lurks an<lb/>
elusive something in the innermost idea of this<lb/>
hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than<lb/>
that redness which affrights in blood.</p>
<p>This elusive quality it is, which causes the<lb/>
thought of whiteness, when divorced from more<lb/>
kindly associations, and coupled with any object<lb/>
terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the<lb/>
furthest bounds. Witness the white bear of the<lb/>
poles, and the white shark of the tropics&#x2014;what<lb/>
but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the<lb/>
transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly<lb/>
whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent<lb/>
mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to<lb/>
the dumb gloating of their aspect; so that not<lb/>
the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so<lb/>
stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or<lb/>
shark.<note xml:id="fn4-301"><p>With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged<lb/>
by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is<lb/>
not the whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the<lb/>
intolerable hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that height-<lb/>
ened hideousness, it might be said, only arises from the circum-<lb/>
stance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands<lb/>
invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence,<lb/>
by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds,<lb/>
the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast. But<lb/>
even assuming all this to be true; yet, were it not for the white-<lb/>
ness, you would not have that intensified terror.</p>
<p>As for the white shark, the white, gliding ghostliness of repose<lb/>
in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely<lb/>
tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped. This pecu-<lb/>
liarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow<lb/>
upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead begins with<lb/>
&#x201C;Requiem eternam&#x201D; (eternal rest), hence <hi rend="i">Requiem</hi>, denominating<lb/>
the mass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in allusion<lb/>
to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark, and the mild<lb/>
deadliness of his habits, the French call him <hi rend="i">Requin</hi>.</p></note></p>
<pb xml:id="n319" n="302"/>
<p>Bethink thee of the albatross: whence come<lb/>
those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale<lb/>
dread, in which that white phantom sails in all<lb/>
imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that<lb/>
spell; but God&#x0027;s great, unflattering laureate,<lb/>
Nature.<note xml:id="fn5-302"><p>I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a<lb/>
prolonged gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From<lb/>
my forenoon watch below, I ascended to the overclouded deck;<lb/>
and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery<lb/>
thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill<lb/>
sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast wings, as if to<lb/>
embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings<lb/>
shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some<lb/>
king&#x0027;s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible,<lb/>
strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets not below the heavens.<lb/>
As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing<lb/>
was so white, its wings so wide; and in those for ever exiled<lb/>
waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions<lb/>
and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I can-<lb/>
not tell&#x2014;can only hint&#x2014;the things that darted through me<lb/>
then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what<lb/>
bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! I never had heard<lb/>
that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is<lb/>
utterly unknown to men ashore! Never! But, some time after,<lb/>
I learned that goney was some seaman&#x0027;s name for albatross. So<lb/>
that by no possibility could Coleridge&#x0027;s wild rhyme have had<lb/>
aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine,<lb/>
when I saw that bird upon the deck. For neither had I then<lb/>
read the rhyme, nor knew the bird to be an albatross. Yet, in<lb/>
saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble<lb/>
merit of the poem and the poet.</p>
<p>I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the<lb/>
bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced<lb/>
in this, that by a solecism of terms, there are birds called grey<lb/>
albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with<lb/>
such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.</p>
<p>But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not,<lb/>
and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl<lb/>
floated on the sea. At last the captain made a postman of it;<lb/>
tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck, with the ship&#x0027;s<lb/>
time and place; and then letting it escape.</p></note></p>
<pb xml:id="n320" n="303"/>
<p>Most famous in our Western annals and Indian<lb/>
traditions is that of the White Steed of the Prai-<lb/>
ries; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-<lb/>
eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the<lb/>
dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty, over-<lb/>
scorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes<lb/>
of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in<lb/>
those days were only fenced by the Rocky Moun-<lb/>
tains and the Alleghanies. At their flaming head<lb/>
he westward trooped it, like that chosen star<lb/>
which every evening leads on the hosts of light.<lb/>
The flashing cascade of his mane, the curving<lb/>
comet of his tail, invested him with housings more<lb/>
resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n321" n="304"/>
furnished him. A most imperial and archangclical<lb/>
apparition of that unfallen, western world which<lb/>
to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters have<lb/>
revived the glories of those prim&#x00E6;val times when<lb/>
Adam walked majestic as a god, bluff-bowed and<lb/>
fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching<lb/>
amid his aides and marshals in the van of count-<lb/>
less cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the<lb/>
plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his circum-<lb/>
ambient subjects browsing all around at the hori-<lb/>
zon, the White Steed gallopingly reviewed them<lb/>
with warm nostrils reddening through his cool<lb/>
milkiness: in whatever aspect he presented him-<lb/>
self, always to the bravest Indians he was the<lb/>
object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can<lb/>
it be questioned, from what stands on legendary<lb/>
record of this noble horse, that it was his spiritual<lb/>
whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with di-<lb/>
vineness: and that this divineness had that in it<lb/>
which, though commanding worship, at the same<lb/>
time enforced a certain nameless terror.</p>
<p>But there are other instances where this white-<lb/>
ness loses all that accessory and strange glory<lb/>
which invests it in the White Steed and Al-<lb/>
batross.</p>
<p>What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly<lb/>
repels and often shocks the eye, as that sometimes<lb/>
he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that<lb/>
whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by<lb/>
the name he bears. The Albino is as well made<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n322" n="305"/>
as other men&#x2014;has no substantive deformity&#x2014;and<lb/>
yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness<lb/>
makes him more strangely hideous than the ugli-<lb/>
est abortion. Why should this be so?</p>
<p>Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her<lb/>
least palpable but not the less malicious agencies,<lb/>
fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attri-<lb/>
tribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect,<lb/>
the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has<lb/>
been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in<lb/>
some historic instances, has the art of human<lb/>
malice omitted so potent an auxiliary. How<lb/>
wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in<lb/>
Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of<lb/>
their faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent<lb/>
murder their bailiff in the market-place!</p>
<p>Nor, in some things, does the common, here-<lb/>
ditary experience of all mankind fail to bear wit-<lb/>
ness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot<lb/>
well be doubted, that the one visible quality in<lb/>
the aspect of the dead which most appals the<lb/>
gazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if<lb/>
indeed that pallor were as much the badge of con-<lb/>
sternation in the other world, as of mortal trepi-<lb/>
dation here. And from that pallor of the dead,<lb/>
we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in<lb/>
which we wrap them. Nor even in our supersti-<lb/>
tions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle<lb/>
round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a milk-<lb/>
white fog&#x2014;Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n323" n="306"/>
add, that even the king of terrors, when personi-<lb/>
fied by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.</p>
<p>Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize what-<lb/>
ever grand or gracious thing he will by whiteness,<lb/>
no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized<lb/>
significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the<lb/>
soul.</p>
<p>But though without dissent this point be fixed,<lb/>
how is mortal man to account for it? To analyse<lb/>
it would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the<lb/>
citation of some of those instances wherein this<lb/>
thing of whiteness&#x2014;though for the time either<lb/>
wholly or in great part stripped of all direct asso-<lb/>
ciations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,<lb/>
but, nevertheless, is found to exert over us the<lb/>
same sorcery, however modified;&#x2014;can we thus<lb/>
hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us<lb/>
to the hidden cause we seek?</p>
<p>Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety<lb/>
appeals to subtlety, and without imagination no<lb/>
man can follow another into these halls. And<lb/>
though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative<lb/>
impressions about to be presented may have been<lb/>
shared by most men, yet few perhaps were en-<lb/>
tirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore<lb/>
may not be able to recall them now.</p>
<p>Why to the man of untutored ideality, who<lb/>
happens to be but loosely acquainted with the<lb/>
peculiar character of the day, does the bare men-<lb/>
tion of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n324" n="307"/>
long, dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing<lb/>
pilgrims, downcast and hooded with new-fallen<lb/>
snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Pro-<lb/>
testant of the Middle American States, why does<lb/>
the passing mention of a White Friar or a White<lb/>
Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?</p>
<p>Or what is there, apart from the traditions of<lb/>
dungeoned warriors and kings (which will not<lb/>
wholly account for it), that makes the White Tower<lb/>
of London tell so much more strongly on the<lb/>
imagination of an untravelled American, than<lb/>
those other storied structures, its neighbours&#x2014;the<lb/>
Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those<lb/>
sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New<lb/>
Hampshire&#x2014;whence, in peculiar moods, comes<lb/>
that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare<lb/>
mention of that name, while the thought of Vir-<lb/>
ginia&#x0027;s blue ridge is full of a soft, dewy, distant<lb/>
dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes<lb/>
and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea<lb/>
exert such a spectralness over the fancy, while<lb/>
that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal<lb/>
thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the<lb/>
waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest<lb/>
of sunsets? Or&#x2014;to choose a wholly unsubstan-<lb/>
tial instance, purely addressed to the fancy&#x2014;why,<lb/>
in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,<lb/>
does &#x201C;the tall, pale man&#x201D; of the Hartz forests,<lb/>
whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through<lb/>
the green of the groves&#x2014;why is this phantom<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n325" n="308"/>
more terrible than all the whooping imps of the<lb/>
Blocksburg?</p>
<p>Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her<lb/>
cathedral-toppling earthquakes; nor the stampe-<lb/>
does of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness of<lb/>
arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her<lb/>
wide field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones,<lb/>
and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of an-<lb/>
chored fleets); and her suburban avenues of<lb/>
house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed<lb/>
pack of cards;&#x2014;it is not these things alone which<lb/>
make tearless Lima, the strangest, saddest city<lb/>
thou canst see. For Lima has taken the white<lb/>
veil; and there is a higher horror in this white-<lb/>
ness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this whiteness<lb/>
keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the<lb/>
cheerful greenness of complete decay; spreads<lb/>
over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an<lb/>
apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.</p>
<p>I know that to the common apprehension, this<lb/>
phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be<lb/>
the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of<lb/>
objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimagina-<lb/>
tive mind is there aught of terror in those appear-<lb/>
ances whose awfulness to another mind almost<lb/>
solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially<lb/>
when exhibited under any form at all approaching<lb/>
to muteness or universality. What I mean by<lb/>
these two statements may perhaps be respectively<lb/>
elucidated by the following examples.</p>
<pb xml:id="n326" n="309"/>
<p>First: the mariner, when drawing nigh the<lb/>
coasts of foreign lands, if by night he hear the<lb/>
roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just<lb/>
enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faenlties;<lb/>
but under precisely similar circumstances, let him<lb/>
be called from his hammock to view his ship sail-<lb/>
ing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness&#x2014;-<lb/>
as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed<lb/>
white bears were swimming round him, then he<lb/>
feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded<lb/>
phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him<lb/>
as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is<lb/>
still off soundings; heart and helm they both go<lb/>
down; he never rests till blue water is under him<lb/>
again. Yet, where is the mariner who will tell<lb/>
thee, &#x201C;Sir, it was not so much the fear of striking<lb/>
hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness<lb/>
that so stirred me?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the<lb/>
continual sight of the snow-howdahed Andes con-<lb/>
veys nought of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere<lb/>
fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reign-<lb/>
ing at such vast altitudes, and the natural conceit<lb/>
of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself<lb/>
in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it<lb/>
with the backwoodsman of the West, who with<lb/>
comparative indifference views an unbounded<lb/>
prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of<lb/>
tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness.<lb/>
Not so the sailor, beholding the scenery of the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n327" n="310"/>
Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal<lb/>
trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and<lb/>
air, he, shivering and half shipwrecked, instead of<lb/>
rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,<lb/>
views what seems a boundless church-yard, grin-<lb/>
ning upon him with its lean ice monuments and<lb/>
splintered crosses.</p>
<p>But thou sayest, Methinks this white-lead chap-<lb/>
ter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out<lb/>
from a craven soul: thou surrenderest to a hypo,<lb/>
Ishmael.</p>
<p>Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in<lb/>
some peaceful valley of Vermont, far removed<lb/>
from all beasts of prey&#x2014;why is it that upon the<lb/>
sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe<lb/>
behind him, so that he cannot even see it, but only<lb/>
smells its wild animal muskiness&#x2014;why will he<lb/>
start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the<lb/>
ground in frenzies of affright? There is no re-<lb/>
membrance in him of any gorings of wild crea-<lb/>
tures in his green northern home, so that the<lb/>
strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him<lb/>
anything associated with the experience of former<lb/>
perils; for what knows he&#x2014;this New England<lb/>
colt&#x2014;of the black bisons of the distant Oregon?</p>
<p>No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb<lb/>
brute, the instinct of the knowledge of the de-<lb/>
monism of the world. Though thousands of miles<lb/>
from Oregon, still, when he smells that savage<lb/>
musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as pre-<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n328" n="311"/>
sent as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies,<lb/>
which this instant they may be trampling into<lb/>
dust.</p>
<p>Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea;<lb/>
the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of moun-<lb/>
tains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed<lb/>
snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the<lb/>
shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened<lb/>
colt!</p>
<p>Though neither knows where lie the nameless<lb/>
things of which the mystic sign gives forth such<lb/>
hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere<lb/>
those things must exist. Though in many of its<lb/>
aspects this visible world seems formed in love,<lb/>
the invisible spheres were formed in fright.</p>
<p>But not yet have we solved the incantation of<lb/>
this whiteness, and learned why it appeals with<lb/>
such power to the soul; and more strange and far<lb/>
more portentous&#x2014;why, as we have seen, it is at<lb/>
once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things,<lb/>
nay, the very veil of the Christian&#x0027;s Deity; and<lb/>
yet should be, as it is, the intensifying agent in<lb/>
things the most appalling to mankind.</p>
<p>Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth<lb/>
the heartless voids and immensities of the uni-<lb/>
verse, and thus stabs us from behind with the<lb/>
thought of annihilation, when beholding the white<lb/>
depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in<lb/>
essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the<lb/>
visible absence of colour, and at the same time the<lb/>
<pb xml:id="n329" n="312"/>
concrete of all colours; is it for these reasons that<lb/>
there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning,<lb/>
in a wide landscape of snows&#x2014;a colourless, all-<lb/>
colour of atheism from which we shrink? And<lb/>
when we consider that other theory of the natural<lb/>
philosophers, that all other earthly hues&#x2014;every<lb/>
stately or lovely emblazoning&#x2014;the sweet tinges<lb/>
of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded<lb/>
velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of<lb/>
young girls; all these are but subtle deceits, not<lb/>
actually inherent in substances, but only laid on<lb/>
from without; and when we proceed further, and<lb/>
consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces<lb/>
every one of her hues, the great principle of light,<lb/>
for ever remains white or colourless in itself, and<lb/>
if operating without medium upon matter, would<lb/>
touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its<lb/>
own blank tinge&#x2014;pondering all this, the palsied<lb/>
universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful<lb/>
travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured<lb/>
and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the<lb/>
wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monu-<lb/>
mental white shroud that wraps all the prospect<lb/>
around him. And of all these things the Albino<lb/>
whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the<lb/>
fiery hunt?</p>
