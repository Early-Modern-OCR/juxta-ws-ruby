<notes>The impulse to bring out a new edition of his poetry probably began in late July 1879, when DGR read T. Hall Caine's lecture on his writing in the text printed in New Monthly Magazine (4th series, I, July 1879). At that time DGR wrote to Jane Morris about his satisfaction that Caine was “enforcing my poetic claims” (Bryson and Troxell 105). Later in the fall he began to make revisions to “Sister Helen” (Bryson and Troxell 124-126). He was preoccupied with his painting work for the next year, but when J. A. Noble praised DGR as England's finest living writer of sonnets (in an article on the sonnet in the Contemporary Review of August, 1880), the poet wrote to Caine that he was “very proud to think that after my small and solitary book has been a good many years published and several out of print, it yet meets with such ardent upholdings by young and sincere men” like Caine and Caine's friend Noble (letter to Caine, quoted in Lewis 203).
        
By December 1879, according to WMR, DGR was seriously planning a new edition of his poetry, including “all his poems subsequently composed [to the 1870 volume], forming probably at least half as much again” (Fredeman, 226). The amount of poetry he had written since the 1870 volume was considerable, and he would augment it further as his publication plans moved forward. At first he contemplated a single new volume, and in December 1880 this was still his plan; the book was “to be called Poems Old and New” (Fredeman, Correspondence, 80.386).
                    
As the contents grew DGR was compelled to plan two volumes instead of one. The new materials and the contents of the 1870 volume were dispersed into the new edition of the Poems and its companion volume, Ballads and Sonnets. The poet came to this decision in January 1881 (see Fredeman, Correspondence, 81.35), and for the next few months he imagined several schemes for organizing the material for the two volumes. The basic form of the books was settled by early May, but publication was delayed for various reasons: the poet's ill health, the publisher's desire for an opportune commercial moment to appear in print, and Jane Morris's apprehensions about the personal cast of the poems in “The House of Life” especially. Poems. A New Edition did not appear until 10 November, about three weeks after the first edition of the Ballads and Sonnets.
