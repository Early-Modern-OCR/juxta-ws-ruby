                        edition was being explicitly broached as early as February 1880, the book
                        became a practical possibility sometime around September 1880, when DGR had
                        finished composing &#8220;<xref doc="a.1-1878.raw">

                        fall, and in November a publication plan was being formulated by DGR's
                        publisher Ellis, who suggested putting &#8220;<quote>the old and the
                            new together</quote>&#8221; in one volume. DGR agreed. The new
                        volume entered its final planning stage in December (see WMR's
                            <bibl>Unpublished Diary, <pages>226</pages>).</bibl>

                        that &#8220;<quote>This series now consists of 100 Sonnets (though I
                            omit several of the M. S. ones) and forms 2 Parts viz Part I Youth and

                        December 1880: <bibl>Bryson, <pages>167-168</pages>)</bibl>. Indeed, all
                        these new sonnets and the new ballads clearly dictated the title of the book
                        that finally emerged.</p>
                    <p> At first DGR planned a single new volume, and in December 1880 this was
                        still his plan; the book was <quote>to be called <hi rend="i">Poems Old and New</hi>
                        </quote> (letter to Mrs. Morris, 17 December: <bibl>Fredeman, <title level="doc">
                                <hi rend="i">Correspondence</hi>
                            </title> 80.386</bibl>). The decision to produce two new volumes, one
                        comprising (for the most part) new poetry, the other older work, was made in
                        January 1881 (see WMR's <bibl>Unpublished Diary, <pages>232</pages>
                        </bibl>). DGR's greatest attention was given to the new work, the <hi rend="i">
                            <title level="doc">Ballads and Sonnets</title>
                        </hi> volume, a fact that shaped the schedule of publication for both
                        books. DGR's customary meticulousness dragged out the production process,
                        which was further delayed by Whittingham's slow delivery of the proofs. And
                        other obstacles arose. First was Jane Morris's apprehensions about the
                        personal character of &#8220;<xref doc="a.22-1881.raw">
                            <title level="wrk">The House of Life</title>
                        </xref>&#8221; sequence, second the publisher's desire &#8212; after so many delays &#8212; to put off publishing even further, until
                        a better commercial moment should arrive. This was judged to be early fall,
                        so while <hi rend="i">
                            <title level="doc">Ballads and Sonnets</title>

                        late October.</p>

                    <p>The composition of the book involves the history of the composition of
                        various individual pieces in the book, and most importantly the three long

                        from the late summer of 1880 to mid-summer 1881. An important event was the

                    <p>Of first importance here is the identity of the printer: Charles Whittingham,
                        and the Chiswick Press. In making this choice DGR was returning to the
                        printer he used for his first book, <hi rend="i">

                        </hi>, and to a printer whose reputation for careful work was very high. The

                        the printing process. Events conspired against their plans, however.</p>
                    <p>As with all of his books, DGR was much concerned with every aspect of the
                        physical appearance of the book. An interesting letter to Ellis (see

                        sonnets on the other &#8212; are treated very differently. The page for
                        the ballads permits only 17 lines of text, whereas the page for the sonnets
                        reverts to the format of the 1870 <hi rend="i">

                    <p>As to the actual printing process, DGR's arrangement with his publisher called for at least three and sometimes four sets of initial proofs for each signature.  One or sometimes two were kept in house and at least two were sent to DGR, who would send a corrected set back to the printer, keeping a corrected set with himself.  Two copies of revise proofs would then be sent back to DGR with one set kept in house, and the revision process would proceed in that way through further revises until DGR was satisfied with the state of the text.  The printing process began on 5 April and was not finally complete until 7 June.</p>
               <p>DGR's brother William Michael was much involved with the revision of the book.  DGR regularly sent copies of his first author's proofs to his brother for comments and suggestions.  In addition, on 17 May DGR told his publisher to print off a complete proof copy of the book and send it to his brother for further inspection, and on 21 May he made the same request that a copy be sent to Theodore Watts.</p>
                    <p>The most intense set of revisions came at two periods.  The first was between 25 April and 3 May, when the initial signatures for &#8220;<xref doc="a.22-1881.raw">
                     <title level="doc">The House of Life</title>
                  </xref>&#8221; arrived to DGR (signatures M and N).  These revisions involved a major redesign of the page plus some of DGR's characteristic moves to shift the position of different sonnets.  The second period dealt with late alterations to &#8220;<xref doc="a.5-1881.raw">
                     <title level="doc">The King's Tragedy</title>
                  </xref>&#8221; (signatures K and L), for which revises were pulled intermittently between 15 May and 7 June.  These changes came about largely because of questions Watts raised about the poem around 20 May.  DGR responded to these over the next few days by writing new material for the poem and revising various passages. </p>
                    <p>The printing schedule (by signature) was as follows: <hi rend="i">Signatures B - G</hi>: first proofs, 5-6 April; first revises, 13-14 April; second revises, 22 April; <hi rend="i">Signatures H - L</hi>: First proofs, 14 April;  <hi rend="i">Signatures M - N</hi>: First proofs, 25 April; 28 April ? 3  May, first and second revises; <hi rend="i">Signatures O - Q</hi>: first proofs, 3-4 May; first revises, 10 May; final proof, 17 May; <hi rend="i">Signatures R - Y</hi>: first proofs, 5-7 May; first revises, 10 May; final proof, 17 May; <hi rend="i">Signature A</hi>: first proofs, 19 May; first, second revises, 21-23 May; last revise, 7 June; <hi rend="i">Signature Z</hi> (not in the BL proofs). This last was sent to DGR on 7 May with the final batch of signatures.  It disappeared from the book when DGR removed two sonnets from signature Y (&#8220;<xref doc="a.16-1849.raw">

                        sheets for 250 copies were sent to the American publisher Roberts Brothers
                        (who issued a second edition of 1000 copies of their own in 1882). In March
                        1882 Ellis was preparing another (the fourth) edition, which was published

                        contemporary and later views of the poet's work in general.
                        Twentieth-century readers tend to see these later ballads as a falling off
                        from DGR's earlier work, whereas most of his contemporaries received them
                        with great favor.</p>

                        DGR's two favorite generic forms, the ballad and the sonnet. It also

                        upon his poetry as artistic work unprostituted by those commercial concerns
                        that he saw dominating his work as a painter.</p>
                    <p>DGR's sister was especially pleased by the ballad form because it avoided the
                        painful aspects of her brother's more personal work. So she urged him to

                        disjunctive character of the volume. It is as if DGR's work, which is
                        nothing if it isn't all of a piece (even obsessively so), were here being
                        arbitrarily compartmentalized. The effort to de-personalize the appearance
                        of his work is carried to an extreme, even to the presentation of

                        story of the delay of the book's publication. DGR himself was worried about

                        intimately in that work. As William Fredeman has observed, there can be no

                            the First of Scots, received popu-<lb/>larly the name of
                            &#8220;Barlass.&#8221; This name remains to
                            her<lb/>descendants, the Barlas family, in Scotland, who bear
                            for<lb/>their crest a broken arm. She married Alexander Lovell of<lb/>Bolunnie.</p>
