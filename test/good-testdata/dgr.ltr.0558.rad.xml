               <salute>Dear Scotus</salute>
            </opener>
                <p>I have such a nice letter from Marzials (detained in London it seems for ever so
                    long) that I send it you on. Never mind returning it till you are back again.</p>
                <p>By the bye, you know very well that I despise the "fly in the foreground" &amp;
                    never put him there in my life myself. What I spoke of was <epage/>
                    <page n="[2]" image="a.dgr.ltr.0558.2-3.tif"/> good taste &amp; good workmanship. Keats (whom you seem
                    to quote as a defaulter proving your case) had both supremely &#8212; no faults at all
                    later than <title level="wrk">Endymion</title>, &amp; those not monstrous. <add>Coleridge was perfect &amp; the real
                    model.</add> Shelley was ungrammatical now &amp; then, <add>through carelessness</add> but never
                    <hi rend="u">wrong</hi> prepensely <add>after Alastor</add>. As for the second &amp; third-rate high-finishers
                    you speak of, I wot not of them. Nothing was ever finished to me that had <epage/>
                    <page n="[3]" image="a.dgr.ltr.0558.2-3.tif"/> not backbone &amp; sinew to work on.</p>
                <p>The representative <hi rend="u">young</hi> book of our time is Morris's first &#8212;
                    his best yet for stirring qualities &amp; certainly this of Marzials (good as much
                    in it is) cannot stand by that or even very near it. The faults in Morris's are
                    only surface work. </p>
                <p> I shall hope very much to meet Marzials who must be a brick. <epage/>
                    <page n="[4]" image="a.dgr.ltr.0558.1-4.tif"/> I suppose you know that John Marshall has got in as
                    Professor of Anatomy at the R.A. What you tell me of old Hart is much what I
                    supposed. I shall always feel kindly towards him, for I believe he wrote a very
                    encouraging notice of my first picture in <title level="per">Athen�um</title> long &amp; long ago. </p>
                <p>I'll copy you a Spring sonnet. By the bye, your old <hi rend="u">favorite</hi>

                    They wrote asking for something &amp; I didn't like to say no though I have come
                    to the conclusion that little things printed here &amp; there deflower one's
                    collected work to little purpose.</p>

                    know I must) that Miss Boyd's best picture &#8212; a phoenix <del>among</del> in female art &#8212; should
                    have been rejected. Never mind, she has done a good thing.</p>
